      In the course of a revised edition of my works I have come to a
      biographical sketch of Goldsmith, published several years since. It was
      written hastily, as introductory to a selection from his writings; and,
      though the facts contained in it were collected from various sources, I
      was chiefly indebted for them to the voluminous work of Mr. James Prior,
      who had collected and collated the most minute particulars of the poet&rsquo;s
      history with unwearied research and scrupulous fidelity; but had rendered
      them, as I thought, in a form too cumbrous and overlaid with details and
      disquisitions, and matters uninteresting to the general reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was about of late to revise my biographical sketch, preparatory to
      republication, a volume was put into my hands, recently given to the
      public by Mr. John Forster, of the Inner Temple, who, likewise availing
      himself of the labors of the indefatigable Prior, and of a few new lights
      since evolved, has produced a biography of the poet, executed with a
      spirit, a feeling, a grace and an eloquence, that leave nothing to be
      desired. Indeed it would have been presumption in me to undertake the
      subject after it had been thus felicitously treated, did I not stand
      committed by my previous sketch. That sketch now appeared too meager and
      insufficient to satisfy public demand; yet it had to take its place in the
      revised series of my works unless something more satisfactory could be
      substituted. Under these circumstances I have again taken up the subject,
      and gone into it with more fullness than formerly, omitting none of the
      facts which I considered illustrative of the life and character of the
      poet, and giving them in as graphic a style as I could command. Still the
      hurried manner in which I have had to do this amid the pressure of other
      claims on my attention, and with the press dogging at my heels, has
      prevented me from giving some parts of the subject the thorough handling I
      could have wished. Those who would like to see it treated still more at
      large, with the addition of critical disquisitions and the advantage of
      collateral facts, would do well to refer themselves to Mr. Prior&rsquo;s
      circumstantial volumes, or to the elegant and discursive pages of Mr.
      Forster.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my own part, I can only regret my shortcomings in what to me is a
      labor of love; for it is a tribute of gratitude to the memory of an author
      whose writings were the delight of my childhood, and have been a source of
      enjoyment to me throughout life; and to whom, of all others, I may address
      the beautiful apostrophe of Dante to Virgil:
    </p>

      There are few writers for whom the reader feels such personal kindness as
      for Oliver Goldsmith, for few have so eminently possessed the magic gift
      of identifying themselves with their writings. We read his character in
      every page, and grow into familiar intimacy with him as we read. The
      artless benevolence that beams throughout his works; the whimsical, yet
      amiable views of human life and human nature; the unforced humor, blending
      so happily with good feeling and good sense, and singularly dashed at
      times with a pleasing melancholy; even the very nature of his mellow, and
      flowing, and softly-tinted style, all seem to bespeak his moral as well as
      his intellectual qualities, and make us love the man at the same time that
      we admire the author. While the productions of writers of loftier
      pretension and more sounding names are suffered to moulder on our shelves,
      those of Goldsmith are cherished and laid in our bosoms. We do not quote
      them with ostentation, but they mingle with our minds, sweeten our
      tempers, and harmonize our thoughts; they put us in good humor with
      ourselves and with the world, and in so doing they make us happier and
      better men.
    </p>
    <p>
      An acquaintance with the private biography of Goldsmith lets us into the
      secret of his gifted pages. We there discover them to be little more than
      transcripts of his own heart and picturings of his fortunes. There he
      shows himself the same kind, artless, good-humored, excursive, sensible,
      whimsical, intelligent being that he appears in his writings. Scarcely an
      adventure or character is given in his works that may not be traced to his
      own party-colored story. Many of his most ludicrous scenes and ridiculous
      incidents have been drawn from his own blunders and mischances, and he
      seems really to have been buffeted into almost every maxim imparted by him
      for the instruction of his reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver Goldsmith was born on the 10th of November, 1728, at the hamlet of
      Pallas, or Pallasmore, county of Longford, in Ireland. He sprang from a
      respectable, but by no means a thrifty stock. Some families seem to
      inherit kindliness and incompetency, and to hand down virtue and poverty
      from generation to generation. Such was the case with the Goldsmiths.
      &ldquo;They were always,&rdquo; according to their own accounts, &ldquo;a
      strange family; they rarely acted like other people; their hearts were in
      the right place, but their heads seemed to be doing anything but what they
      ought.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They were remarkable,&rdquo; says another
      statement, &ldquo;for their worth, but of no cleverness in the ways of the
      world.&rdquo; Oliver Goldsmith will be found faithfully to inherit the
      virtues and weaknesses of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, the Rev. Charles Goldsmith, with hereditary improvidence,
      married when very young and very poor, and starved along for several years
      on a small country curacy and the assistance of his wife&rsquo;s friends.
      His whole income, eked out by the produce of some fields which he farmed,
      and of some occasional duties performed for his wife&rsquo;s uncle, the
      rector of an adjoining parish, did not exceed forty pounds.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;And passing rich with forty pounds a year.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He inhabited an old, half rustic mansion that stood on a rising ground in
      a rough, lonely part of the country, overlooking a low tract occasionally
      flooded by the river Inny. In this house Goldsmith was born, and it was a
      birthplace worthy of a poet; for, by all accounts, it was haunted ground.
      A tradition handed down among the neighboring peasantry states that, in
      after years, the house, remaining for some time untenanted, went to decay,
      the roof fell in, and it became so lonely and forlorn as to be a resort
      for the &ldquo;good people&rdquo; or fairies, who in Ireland are supposed
      to delight in old, crazy, deserted mansions for their midnight revels. All
      attempts to repair it were in vain; the fairies battled stoutly to
      maintain possession. A huge misshapen hobgoblin used to bestride the house
      every evening with an immense pair of jack-boots, which, in his efforts at
      hard riding, he would thrust through the roof, kicking to pieces all the
      work of the preceding day. The house was therefore left to its fate, and
      went to ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the popular tradition about Goldsmith&rsquo;s birthplace. About
      two years after his birth a change came over the circumstances of his
      father. By the death of his wife&rsquo;s uncle he succeeded to the rectory
      of Kilkenny West; and, abandoning the old goblin mansion, he removed to
      Lissoy, in the county of Westmeath, where he occupied a farm of seventy
      acres, situated on the skirts of that pretty little village.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the scene of Goldsmith&rsquo;s boyhood, the little world whence
      he drew many of those pictures, rural and domestic, whimsical and
      touching, which abound throughout his works, and which appeal so
      eloquently both to the fancy and the heart. Lissoy is confidently cited as
      the original of his &ldquo;Auburn&rdquo; in the Deserted Village; his
      father&rsquo;s establishment, a mixture of farm and parsonage, furnished
      hints, it is said, for the rural economy of the Vicar of Wakefield; and
      his father himself, with his learned simplicity, his guileless wisdom, his
      amiable piety, and utter ignorance of the world, has been exquisitely
      portrayed in the worthy Dr. Primrose. Let us pause for a moment, and draw
      from Goldsmith&rsquo;s writings one or two of those pictures which, under
      feigned names, represent his father and his family, and the happy fireside
      of his childish days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; says the &ldquo;Man in Black,&rdquo; who, in some
      respects, is a counterpart of Goldsmith himself, &ldquo;my father, the
      younger son of a good family, was possessed of a small living in the
      church. His education was above his fortune, and his generosity greater
      than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers poorer than
      himself; for every dinner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in
      praise; and this was all he wanted. The same ambition that actuates a
      monarch at the head of his army influenced my father at the head of his
      table: he told the story of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he
      repeated the jest of the two scholars and one pair of breeches, and the
      company laughed at that; but the story of Taffy in the sedan chair was
      sure to set the table in a roar. Thus his pleasure increased in proportion
      to the pleasure he gave; he loved all the world, and he fancied all the
      world loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As his fortune was but small, he lived up to the very extent of it;
      he had no intention of leaving his children money, for that was dross; he
      resolved they should have learning, for learning, he used to observe, was
      better than silver or gold. For this purpose he undertook to instruct us
      himself, and took as much care to form our morals as to improve our
      understanding. We were told that universal benevolence was what first
      cemented society; we were taught to consider all the wants of mankind as
      our own; to regard the <i>human face divine</i> with affection and esteem;
      he wound us up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of
      withstanding the slightest impulse made either by real or fictitious
      distress. In a word, we were perfectly instructed in the art of giving
      away thousands before we were taught the necessary qualifications of
      getting a farthing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Deserted Village we have another picture of his father and his
      father&rsquo;s fireside:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;His house was known to all the vagrant train,
  He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;
  The long-remembered beggar was his guest,
  Whose beard, descending, swept his aged breast;
  The ruin&rsquo;d spendthrift, now no longer proud
  Claim&rsquo;d kindred there, and had his claims allow&rsquo;d;
  The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay.
  Sat by his fire, and talk&rsquo;d the night away;
  Wept o&rsquo;er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,
  Shoulder&rsquo;d his crutch, and show&rsquo;d how fields were won.
  Pleased with his guests, the good man learned to glow
  And quite forgot their vices in their woe;
  Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
  His pity gave ere charity began.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The family of the worthy pastor consisted of five sons and three
      daughters. Henry, the eldest, was the good man&rsquo;s pride and hope, and
      he tasked his slender means to the utmost in educating him for a learned
      and distinguished career. Oliver was the second son, and seven years
      younger than Henry, who was the guide and protector of his childhood, and
      to whom he was most tenderly attached throughout life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver&rsquo;s education began when he was about three years old; that is
      to say, he was gathered under the wings of one of those good old motherly
      dames, found in every village, who cluck together the whole callow brood
      of the neighborhood, to teach them their letters and keep them out of harm&rsquo;s
      way. Mistress Elizabeth Delap, for that was her name, flourished in this
      capacity for upward of fifty years, and it was the pride and boast of her
      declining days, when nearly ninety years of age, that she was the first
      that had put a book (doubtless a hornbook) into Goldsmith&rsquo;s hands.
      Apparently he did not much profit by it, for she confessed he was one of
      the dullest boys she had ever dealt with, insomuch that she had sometimes
      doubted whether it was possible to make anything of him: a common case
      with imaginative children, who are apt to be beguiled from the dry
      abstractions of elementary study by the picturings of the fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six years of age he passed into the hands of the village schoolmaster,
      one Thomas (or, as he was commonly and irreverently named, Paddy) Byrne, a
      capital tutor for a poet. He had been educated for a pedagogue, but had
      enlisted in the army, served abroad during the wars of Queen Anne&rsquo;s
      time, and risen to the rank of quartermaster of a regiment in Spain. At
      the return of peace, having no longer exercise for the sword, he resumed
      the ferule, and drilled the urchin populace of Lissoy. Goldsmith is
      supposed to have had him and his school in view in the following sketch in
      his Deserted Village:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way,
  With blossom&rsquo;d furze unprofitably gay,
  There, in his noisy mansion, skill&rsquo;d to rule,
  The village master taught his little school;
  A man severe he was, and stern to view,
  I knew him well, and every truant knew:
  Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace
  The day&rsquo;s disasters in his morning face;
  Full well they laugh&rsquo;d with counterfeited glee
  At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;
  Full well the busy whisper circling round,
  Convey&rsquo;d the dismal tidings when he frown&rsquo;d:
  Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,
  The love he bore to learning was in fault;
  The village all declared how much he knew,
  &lsquo;Twas certain he could write and cipher too;
  Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage,
  And e&rsquo;en the story ran that he could gauge:
  In arguing, too, the parson own&rsquo;d his skill,
  For, e&rsquo;en though vanquished, he could argue still;
  While words of learned length and thund&rsquo;ring sound
  Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around&mdash;
  And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,
  That one small head could carry all he knew.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      There are certain whimsical traits in the character of Byrne, not given in
      the foregoing sketch. He was fond of talking of his vagabond wanderings in
      foreign lands, and had brought with him from the wars a world of
      campaigning stories, of which he was generally the hero, and which he
      would deal forth to his wondering scholars when he ought to have been
      teaching them their lessons. These travelers&rsquo; tales had a powerful
      effect upon the vivid imagination of Goldsmith, and awakened an
      unconquerable passion for wandering and seeking adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Byrne was, moreover, of a romantic vein, and exceedingly superstitious. He
      was deeply versed in the fairy superstitions which abound in Ireland, all
      which he professed implicitly to believe. Under his tuition Goldsmith soon
      became almost as great a proficient in fairy lore. From this branch of
      good-for-nothing knowledge, his studies, by an easy transition, extended
      to the histories of robbers, pirates, smugglers, and the whole race of
      Irish rogues and rapparees. Everything, in short, that savored of romance,
      fable, and adventure was congenial to his poetic mind, and took instant
      root there; but the slow plants of useful knowledge were apt to be
      overrun, if not choked, by the weeds of his quick imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another trait of his motley preceptor, Byrne, was a disposition to dabble
      in poetry, and this likewise was caught by his pupil. Before he was eight
      years old Goldsmith had contracted a habit of scribbling verses on small
      scraps of paper, which, in a little while, he would throw into the fire. A
      few of these sybilline leaves, however, were rescued from the flames and
      conveyed to his mother. The good woman read them with a mother&rsquo;s
      delight, and saw at once that her son was a genius and a poet. From that
      time she beset her husband with solicitations to give the boy an education
      suitable to his talents. The worthy man was already straitened by the
      costs of instruction of his eldest son Henry, and had intended to bring
      his second son up to a trade; but the mother would listen to no such
      thing; as usual, her influence prevailed, and Oliver, instead of being
      instructed in some humble but cheerful and gainful handicraft, was devoted
      to poverty and the Muse.
    </p>
    <p>
      A severe attack of the small-pox caused him to be taken from under the
      care of his story-telling preceptor, Byrne. His malady had nearly proved
      fatal, and his face remained pitted through life. On his recovery he was
      placed under the charge of the Rev. Mr. Griffin, schoolmaster of Elphin,
      in Roscommon, and became an inmate in the house of his uncle, John
      Goldsmith, Esq., of Ballyoughter, in that vicinity. He now entered upon
      studies of a higher order, but without making any uncommon progress. Still
      a careless, easy facility of disposition, an amusing eccentricity of
      manners, and a vein of quiet and peculiar humor, rendered him a general
      favorite, and a trifling incident soon induced his uncle&rsquo;s family to
      concur in his mother&rsquo;s opinion of his genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of young folks had assembled at his uncle&rsquo;s to dance. One
      of the company, named Cummings, played on the violin. In the course of the
      evening Oliver undertook a hornpipe. His short and clumsy figure, and his
      face pitted and discolored with the small-pox, rendered him a ludicrous
      figure in the eyes of the musician, who made merry at his expense, dubbing
      him his little Aesop. Goldsmith was nettled by the jest, and, stopping
      short in the hornpipe, exclaimed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Our herald hath proclaimed this saying,
  See Aesop dancing, and his monkey playing.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The repartee was thought wonderful for a boy of nine years old, and Oliver
      became forthwith the wit and the bright genius of the family. It was
      thought a pity he should not receive the same advantages with his elder
      brother Henry, who had been sent to the University; and, as his father&rsquo;s
      circumstances would not afford it, several of his relatives, spurred on by
      the representations of his mother, agreed to contribute toward the
      expense. The greater part, however, was borne by his uncle, the Rev.
      Thomas Contarine. This worthy man had been the college companion of Bishop
      Berkeley, and was possessed of moderate means, holding the living of
      Carrick-on-Shannon. He had married the sister of Goldsmith&rsquo;s father,
      but was now a widower, with an only child, a daughter, named Jane.
      Contarine was a kind-hearted man, with a generosity beyond his means. He
      took Goldsmith into favor from his infancy; his house was open to him
      during the holidays; his daughter Jane, two years older than the poet, was
      his early playmate, and uncle Contarine continued to the last one of his
      most active, unwavering, and generous friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitted out in a great measure by this considerate relative, Oliver was now
      transferred to schools of a higher order, to prepare him for the
      University; first to one at Athlone, kept by the Rev. Mr. Campbell, and,
      at the end of two years, to one at Edgeworthstown, under the
      superintendence of the Rev. Patrick Hughes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at these schools his proficiency does not appear to have been
      brilliant. He was indolent and careless, however, rather than dull, and,
      on the whole, appears to have been well thought of by his teachers. In his
      studies he inclined toward the Latin poets and historians; relished Ovid
      and Horace, and delighted in Livy. He exercised himself with pleasure in
      reading and translating Tacitus, and was brought to pay attention to style
      in his compositions by a reproof from his brother Henry, to whom he had
      written brief and confused letters, and who told him in reply that if he
      had but little to say to endeavor to say that little well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The career of his brother Henry at the University was enough to stimulate
      him to exertion. He seemed to be realizing all his father&rsquo;s hopes,
      and was winning collegiate honors that the good man considered indicative
      of his future success in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile Oliver, if not distinguished among his teachers, was
      popular among his schoolmates. He had a thoughtless generosity extremely
      captivating to young hearts; his temper was quick and sensitive, and
      easily offended; but his anger was momentary, and it was impossible for
      him to harbor resentment. He was the leader of all boyish sports and
      athletic amusements, especially ball-playing, and he was foremost in all
      mischievous pranks. Many years afterward, an old man, Jack Fitzimmons, one
      of the directors of the sports and keeper of the ball-court at Ballymahon,
      used to boast of having been schoolmate of &ldquo;Noll Goldsmith,&rdquo;
      as he called him, and would dwell with vainglory on one of their exploits,
      in robbing the orchard of Tirlicken, an old family residence of Lord
      Annaly. The exploit, however, had nearly involved disastrous consequences;
      for the crew of juvenile depredators were captured, like Shakespeare and
      his deer-stealing colleagues, and nothing but the respectability of
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s connections saved him from the punishment that would
      have awaited more plebeian delinquents.
    </p>
    <p>
      An amusing incident is related as occurring in Goldsmith&rsquo;s last
      journey homeward from Edgeworthstown. His father&rsquo;s house was about
      twenty miles distant; the road lay through a rough country, impassable for
      carriages. Goldsmith procured a horse for the journey, and a friend
      furnished him with a guinea for traveling expenses. He was but a stripling
      of sixteen, and being thus suddenly mounted on horseback, with money in
      his pocket, it is no wonder that his head was turned. He determined to
      play the man, and to spend his money in independent traveler&rsquo;s
      style. Accordingly, instead of pushing directly for home, he halted for
      the night at the little town of Ardagh, and, accosting the first person he
      met, inquired, with somewhat of a consequential air, for the best house in
      the place. Unluckily, the person he had accosted was one Kelly, a
      notorious wag, who was quartered in the family of one Mr. Featherstone, a
      gentleman of fortune. Amused with the self-consequence of the stripling,
      and willing to play off a practical joke at his expense, he directed him
      to what was literally &ldquo;the best house in the place,&rdquo; namely,
      the family mansion of Mr. Featherstone. Goldsmith accordingly rode up to
      what he supposed to be an inn, ordered his horse to be taken to the
      stable, walked into the parlor, seated himself by the fire, and demanded
      what he could have for supper. On ordinary occasions he was diffident and
      even awkward in his manners, but here he was &ldquo;at ease in his inn,&rdquo;
      and felt called upon to show his manhood and enact the experienced
      traveler. His person was by no means calculated to play off his
      pretensions, for he was short and thick, with a pock-marked face, and an
      air and carriage by no means of a distinguished cast. The owner of the
      house, however, soon discovered his whimsical mistake, and, being a man of
      humor, determined to indulge it, especially as he accidentally learned
      that this intruding guest was the son of an old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly Goldsmith was &ldquo;fooled to the top of his bent,&rdquo; and
      permitted to have full sway throughout the evening. Never was schoolboy
      more elated. When supper was served, he most condescendingly insisted that
      the landlord, his wife and daughter should partake, and ordered a bottle
      of wine to crown the repast and benefit the house. His last flourish was
      on going to bed, when he gave especial orders to have a hot cake at
      breakfast. His confusion and dismay, on discovering the next morning that
      he had been swaggering in this free and easy way in the house of a private
      gentleman, may be readily conceived. True to his habit of turning the
      events of his life to literary account, we find this chapter of ludicrous
      blunders and cross purposes dramatized many years afterward in his
      admirable comedy of &ldquo;She Stoops to Conquer, or the Mistakes of a
      Night.&rdquo;

    <p>
      While Oliver was making his way somewhat negligently through the schools,
      his elder brother Henry was rejoicing his father&rsquo;s heart by his
      career at the University. He soon distinguished himself at the
      examinations, and obtained a scholarship in 1743. This is a collegiate
      distinction which serves as a stepping-stone in any of the learned
      professions, and which leads to advancement in the University should the
      individual choose to remain there. His father now trusted that he would
      push forward for that comfortable provision, a fellowship, and thence to
      higher dignities and emoluments. Henry, however, had the improvidence or
      the &ldquo;unworldliness&rdquo; of his race; returning to the country
      during the succeeding vacation, he married for love, relinquished, of
      course, all his collegiate prospects and advantages, set up a school in
      his father&rsquo;s neighborhood, and buried his talents and acquirements
      for the remainder of his life in a curacy of forty pounds a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another matrimonial event occurred not long afterward in the Goldsmith
      family, to disturb the equanimity of its worthy head. This was the
      clandestine marriage of his daughter Catherine with a young gentleman of
      the name of Hodson, who had been confided to the care of her brother Henry
      to complete his studies. As the youth was of wealthy parentage, it was
      thought a lucky match for the Goldsmith family; but the tidings of the
      event stung the bride&rsquo;s father to the soul. Proud of his integrity,
      and jealous of that good name which was his chief possession, he saw
      himself and his family subjected to the degrading suspicion of having
      abused a trust reposed in them to promote a mercenary match. In the first
      transports of his feelings he is said to have uttered a wish that his
      daughter might never have a child to bring like shame and sorrow on her
      head. The hasty wish, so contrary to the usual benignity of the man, was
      recalled and repented of almost as soon as uttered; but it was considered
      baleful in its effects by the superstitious neighborhood; for, though his
      daughter bore three children, they all died before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more effectual measure was taken by Mr. Goldsmith to ward off the
      apprehended imputation, but one which imposed a heavy burden on his
      family. This was to furnish a marriage portion of four hundred pounds,
      that his daughter might not be said to have entered her husband&rsquo;s
      family empty-handed. To raise the sum in cash was impossible; but he
      assigned to Mr. Hodson his little farm and the income of his tithes until
      the marriage portion should be paid. In the meantime, as his living did
      not amount to £200 per annum, he had to practice the strictest economy to
      pay off gradually this heavy tax incurred by his nice sense of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of his family to feel the effects of this economy was Oliver.
      The time had now arrived for him to be sent to the University, and,
      accordingly, on the 11th of June, 1747, when sixteen years of age, he
      entered Trinity College, Dublin; but his father was no longer able to
      place him there as a pensioner, as he had done his eldest son Henry; he
      was obliged, therefore, to enter him as a sizer or &ldquo;poor scholar.&rdquo;
      He was lodged in one of the top rooms adjoining the library of the
      building, numbered 35, where it is said his name may still be seen,
      scratched by himself upon a window frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      A student of this class is taught and boarded gratuitously, and has to pay
      but a very small sum for his room. It is expected, in return for these
      advantages, that he will be a diligent student, and render himself useful
      in a variety of ways. In Trinity College, at the time of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      admission, several derogatory and indeed menial offices were exacted from
      the sizer, as if the college sought to indemnify itself for conferring
      benefits by inflicting indignities. He was obliged to sweep part of the
      courts in the morning, to carry up the dishes from the kitchen to the
      fellows&rsquo; table, and to wait in the hall until that body had dined.
      His very dress marked the inferiority of the &ldquo;poor student&rdquo; to
      his happier classmates. It was a black gown of coarse stuff without
      sleeves, and a plain black cloth cap without a tassel. We can conceive
      nothing more odious and ill-judged than these distinctions, which attached
      the idea of degradation to poverty, and placed the indigent youth of merit
      below the worthless minion of fortune. They were calculated to wound and
      irritate the noble mind, and to render the base mind baser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the galling effect of these servile tasks upon youths of proud
      spirits and quick sensibilities became at length too notorious to be
      disregarded. About fifty years since, on a Trinity Sunday, a number of
      persons were assembled to witness the college ceremonies; and as a sizer
      was carrying up a dish of meat to the fellows&rsquo; table, a burly
      citizen in the crowd made some sneering observation on the servility of
      his office. Stung to the quick, the high-spirited youth instantly flung
      the dish and its contents at the head of the sneerer. The sizer was
      sharply reprimanded for this outbreak of wounded pride, but the degrading
      task was from that day forward very properly consigned to menial hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with the utmost repugnance that Goldsmith entered college in this
      capacity. His shy and sensitive nature was affected by the inferior
      station he was doomed to hold among his gay and opulent fellow-students,
      and he became, at times, moody and despondent. A recollection of these
      early mortifications induced him, in after years, most strongly to
      dissuade his brother Henry, the clergyman, from sending a son to college
      on a like footing. &ldquo;If he has ambition, strong passions, and an
      exquisite sensibility of contempt, do not send him there, unless you have
      no other trade for him except your own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to his annoyances the fellow of the college who had the peculiar
      control of his studies, the Rev. Theaker Wilder, was a man of violent and
      capricious temper, and of diametrically opposite tastes. The tutor was
      devoted to the exact sciences; Goldsmith was for the classics. Wilder
      endeavored to force his favorite studies upon the student by harsh means,
      suggested by his own coarse and savage nature. He abused him in presence
      of the class as ignorant and stupid; ridiculed him as awkward and ugly,
      and at times in the transports of his temper indulged in personal
      violence. The effect was to aggravate a passive distaste into a positive
      aversion. Goldsmith was loud in expressing his contempt for mathematics
      and his dislike of ethics and logic; and the prejudices thus imbibed
      continued through life. Mathematics he always pronounced a science to
      which the meanest intellects were competent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A truer cause of this distaste for the severer studies may probably be
      found in his natural indolence and his love of convivial pleasures.
      &ldquo;I was a lover of mirth, good humor, and even sometimes of fun,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;from my childhood.&rdquo; He sang a good song, was a boon
      companion, and could not resist any temptation to social enjoyment. He
      endeavored to persuade himself that learning and dullness went hand in
      hand, and that genius was not to be put in harness. Even in riper years,
      when the consciousness of his own deficiencies ought to have convinced him
      of the importance of early study, he speaks slightingly of college honors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lad,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;whose passions are not strong enough
      in youth to mislead him from that path of science which his tutors, and
      not his inclination, have chalked out, by four or five years&rsquo;
      perseverance will probably obtain every advantage and honor his college
      can bestow. I would compare the man whose youth has been thus passed in
      the tranquillity of dispassionate prudence, to liquors that never ferment,
      and, consequently, continue always muddy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of his worthy father, which took place early in 1747, rendered
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s situation at college extremely irksome. His mother was
      left with little more than the means of providing for the wants of her
      household, and was unable to furnish him any remittances. He would have
      been compelled, therefore, to leave college, had it not been for the
      occasional contributions of friends, the foremost among whom was his
      generous and warm-hearted uncle Contarine. Still these supplies were so
      scanty and precarious that in the intervals between them he was put to
      great straits. He had two college associates from whom he would
      occasionally borrow small sums; one was an early schoolmate, by the name
      of Beatty; the other a cousin, and the chosen companion of his frolics,
      Robert (or rather Bob) Bryanton, of Ballymulvey House, near Ballymahon.
      When these casual supplies failed him he was more than once obliged to
      raise funds for his immediate wants by pawning his books. At times he sank
      into despondency, but he had what he termed &ldquo;a knack at hoping,&rdquo;
      which soon buoyed him up again. He began now to resort to his poetical
      vein as a source of profit, scribbling street-ballads, which he privately
      sold for five shillings each at a shop which dealt in such small wares of
      literature. He felt an author&rsquo;s affection for these unowned
      bantlings, and we are told would stroll privately through the streets at
      night to hear them sung, listening to the comments and criticisms of
      bystanders, and observing the degree of applause which each received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmund Burke was a fellow-student with Goldsmith at the college. Neither
      the statesman nor the poet gave promise of their future celebrity, though
      Burke certainly surpassed his contemporary in industry and application,
      and evinced more disposition for self-improvement, associating himself
      with a number of his fellow-students in a debating club, in which they
      discussed literary topics, and exercised themselves in composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith may likewise have belonged to this association, but his
      propensity was rather to mingle with the gay and thoughtless. On one
      occasion we find him implicated in an affair that came nigh producing his
      expulsion. A report was brought to college that a scholar was in the hands
      of the bailiffs. This was an insult in which every gownsman felt himself
      involved. A number of the scholars flew to arms, and sallied forth to
      battle, headed by a hare-brained fellow nicknamed Gallows Walsh, noted for
      his aptness at mischief and fondness for riot. The stronghold of the
      bailiff was carried by storm, the scholar set at liberty, and the
      delinquent catchpole borne off captive to the college, where, having no
      pump to put him under, they satisfied the demands of collegiate law by
      ducking him in an old cistern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flushed with this signal victory, Gallows Walsh now harangued his
      followers, and proposed to break open Newgate, or the Black Dog, as the
      prison was called, and effect a general jail delivery. He was answered by
      shouts of concurrence, and away went the throng of madcap youngsters,
      fully bent upon putting an end to the tyranny of law. They were joined by
      the mob of the city, and made an attack upon the prison with true Irish
      precipitation and thoughtlessness, never having provided themselves with
      cannon to batter its stone walls. A few shots from the prison brought them
      to their senses, and they beat a hasty retreat, two of the townsmen being
      killed, and several wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A severe scrutiny of this affair took place at the University. Four
      students, who had been ringleaders, were expelled; four others, who had
      been prominent in the affray, were publicly admonished; among the latter
      was the unlucky Goldsmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make up for this disgrace, he gained, within a month afterward, one of
      the minor prizes of the college. It is true it was one of the very
      smallest, amounting in pecuniary value to but thirty shillings, but it was
      the first distinction he had gained in his whole collegiate career. This
      turn of success and sudden influx of wealth proved too much for the head
      of our poor student. He forthwith gave a supper and dance at his chamber
      to a number of young persons of both sexes from the city, in direct
      violation of college rules. The unwonted sound of the fiddle reached the
      ears of the implacable Wilder. He rushed to the scene of unhallowed
      festivity, inflicted corporal punishment on the &ldquo;father of the
      feast,&rdquo; and turned his astonished guests neck and heels out of
      doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      This filled the measure of poor Goldsmith&rsquo;s humiliations; he felt
      degraded both within college and without. He dreaded the ridicule of his
      fellow-students for the ludicrous termination of his orgy, and he was
      ashamed to meet his city acquaintances after the degrading chastisement
      received in their presence, and after their own ignominious expulsion.
      Above all, he felt it impossible to submit any longer to the insulting
      tyranny of Wilder; he determined, therefore, to leave, not merely the
      college, but also his native land, and to bury what he conceived to be his
      irretrievable disgrace in some distant country. He accordingly sold his
      books and clothes, and sallied forth from the college walls the very next
      day, intending to embark at Cork for&mdash;he scarce knew where&mdash;America,
      or any other part beyond sea. With his usual heedless imprudence, however,
      he loitered about Dublin until his finances were reduced to a shilling;
      with this amount of specie he set out on his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three whole days he subsisted on his shilling; when that was spent, he
      parted with some of the clothes from his back, until, reduced almost to
      nakedness, he was four-and-twenty hours without food, insomuch that he
      declared a handful of gray peas, given to him by a girl at a wake, was one
      of the most delicious repasts he had ever tasted. Hunger, fatigue, and
      destitution brought down his spirit and calmed his anger. Fain would he
      have retraced his steps, could he have done so with any salvo for the
      lingerings of his pride. In his extremity he conveyed to his brother Henry
      information of his distress, and of the rash project on which he had set
      out. His affectionate brother hastened to his relief; furnished him with
      money and clothes; soothed his feelings with gentle counsel; prevailed
      upon him to return to college, and effected an indifferent reconciliation
      between him and Wilder.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this irregular sally upon life he remained nearly two years longer
      at the University, giving proofs of talent in occasional translations from
      the classics, for one of which he received a premium, awarded only to
      those who are the first in literary merit. Still he never made much figure
      at college, his natural disinclination to study being increased by the
      harsh treatment he continued to experience from his tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the anecdotes told of him while at college is one indicative of that
      prompt but thoughtless and often whimsical benevolence which throughout
      life formed one of the most eccentric yet endearing points of his
      character. He was engaged to breakfast one day with a college intimate,
      but failed to make his appearance. His friend repaired to his room,
      knocked at the door, and was bidden to enter. To his surprise, he found
      Goldsmith in his bed, immersed to his chin in feathers. A serio-comic
      story explained the circumstance. In the course of the preceding evening&rsquo;s
      stroll he had met with a woman with five children, who implored his
      charity. Her husband was in the hospital; she was just from the country, a
      stranger, and destitute, without food or shelter for her helpless
      offspring. This was too much for the kind heart of Goldsmith. He was
      almost as poor as herself, it is true, and had no money in his pocket; but
      he brought her to the college gate, gave her the blankets from his bed to
      cover her little brood, and part of his clothes for her to sell and
      purchase food; and, finding himself cold during the night, had cut open
      his bed and buried himself among the feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, on the 27th of February, 1749, O.S., he was admitted to the
      degree of Bachelor of Arts, and took his final leave of the University. He
      was freed from college rule, that emancipation so ardently coveted by the
      thoughtless student, and which too generally launches him amid the cares,
      the hardships, and vicissitudes of life. He was freed, too, from the
      brutal tyranny of Wilder. If his kind and placable nature could retain any
      resentment for past injuries, it might have been gratified by learning
      subsequently that the passionate career of Wilder was terminated by a
      violent death in the course of a dissolute brawl; but Goldsmith took no
      delight in the misfortunes even of his enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now returned to his friends, no longer the student to sport away the
      happy interval of vacation, but the anxious man, who is henceforth to
      shift for himself and make his way through the world. In fact, he had no
      legitimate home to return to. At the death of his father, the paternal
      house at Lissoy, in which Goldsmith had passed his childhood, had been
      taken by Mr. Hodson, who had married his sister Catherine. His mother had
      removed to Ballymahon, where she occupied a small house, and had to
      practice the severest frugality. His elder brother Henry served the curacy
      and taught the school of his late father&rsquo;s parish, and lived in
      narrow circumstances at Goldsmith&rsquo;s birthplace, the old goblin house
      at Pallas.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of his relatives were in circumstances to aid him with anything more
      than a temporary home, and the aspect of every one seemed somewhat
      changed. In fact, his career at college had disappointed his friends, and
      they began to doubt his being the great genius they had fancied him. He
      whimsically alludes to this circumstance in that piece of autobiography,
      &ldquo;The Man in Black,&rdquo; in the Citizen of the World.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first opportunity my father had of finding his expectations
      disappointed was in the middling figure I made at the University; he had
      flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank
      in literary reputation, but was mortified to find me utterly unnoticed and
      unknown. His disappointment might have been partly ascribed to his having
      overrated my talents, and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings
      at a time when my imagination and memory, yet unsatisfied, were more eager
      after new objects than desirous of reasoning upon those I knew. This,
      however, did not please my tutors, who observed, indeed, that I was a
      little dull, but at the same time allowed that I seemed to be very
      good-natured, and had no harm in me.&rdquo; [Footnote: Citizen of the
      World, Letter xxvii.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The only one of his relatives who did not appear to lose faith in him was
      his uncle Contarine. This kind and considerate man, it is said, saw in him
      a warmth of heart requiring some skill to direct, and a latent genius that
      wanted time to mature, and these impressions none of his subsequent
      follies and irregularities wholly obliterated. His purse and affection,
      therefore, as well as his house, were now open to him, and he became his
      chief counselor and director after his father&rsquo;s death. He urged him
      to prepare for holy orders, and others of his relatives concurred in the
      advice. Goldsmith had a settled repugnance to a clerical life. This has
      been ascribed by some to conscientious scruples, not considering himself
      of a temper and frame of mind for such a sacred office; others attributed
      it to his roving propensities, and his desire to visit foreign countries;
      he himself gives a whimsical objection in his biography of the &ldquo;Man
      in Black&rdquo;: &ldquo;To be obliged to wear a long wig when I liked a
      short one, or a black coat when I generally dressed in brown, I thought
      such a restraint upon my liberty that I absolutely rejected the proposal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In effect, however, his scruples were overruled, and he agreed to qualify
      himself for the office. He was now only twenty-one, and must pass two
      years of probation. They were two years of rather loitering, unsettled
      life. Sometimes he was at Lissoy, participating with thoughtless enjoyment
      in the rural sports and occupations of his brother-in-law, Mr. Hodson;
      sometimes he was with his brother Henry, at the old goblin mansion at
      Pallas, assisting him occasionally in his school. The early marriage and
      unambitious retirement of Henry, though so subversive of the fond plans of
      his father, had proved happy in their results. He was already surrounded
      by a blooming family; he was contented with his lot, beloved by his
      parishioners, and lived in the daily practice of all the amiable virtues,
      and the immediate enjoyment of their reward. Of the tender affection
      inspired in the breast of Goldsmith by the constant kindness of this
      excellent brother, and of the longing recollection with which, in the
      lonely wanderings of after years, he looked back upon this scene of
      domestic felicity, we have a touching instance in the well-known opening
      to his poem of The Traveler:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Remote, unfriended, melancholy, slow,
  Or by the lazy Scheld or wandering Po;

 &ldquo;Where&rsquo;er I roam, whatever realms to see,
  My heart untravel&rsquo;d fondly turns to thee;
  Still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain,
  And drags at each remove a lengthening chain.

 &ldquo;Eternal blessings crown my earliest friend,
  And round his dwelling guardian saints attend;
  Bless&rsquo;d be that spot, where cheerful guests retire
  To pause from toil, and trim their evening fire;
  Bless&rsquo;d that abode, where want and pain repair,
  And every stranger finds a ready chair:
  Bless&rsquo;d be those feasts with simple plenty crown&rsquo;d,
  Where all the ruddy family around
  Laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail,
  Or sigh with pity at some mournful tale;
  Or press the bashful stranger to his food,
  And learn the luxury of doing good.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      During this loitering life Goldsmith pursued no study, but rather amused
      himself with miscellaneous reading; such as biography, travels, poetry,
      novels, plays&mdash;everything, in short, that administered to the
      imagination. Sometimes he strolled along the banks of the river Inny,
      where, in after years, when he had become famous, his favorite seats and
      haunts used to be pointed out. Often he joined in the rustic sports of the
      villagers, and became adroit at throwing the sledge, a favorite feat of
      activity and strength in Ireland. Recollections of these &ldquo;healthful
      sports&rdquo; we find in his Deserted Village:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How often have I bless&rsquo;d the coming day,
  When toil remitting lent its turn to play,
  And all the village train, from labor free,
  Led up their sports beneath the spreading tree:
  And many a gambol frolicked o&rsquo;er the ground,
  And sleights of art and feats of strength went round.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A boon companion in all his rural amusements was his cousin and college
      crony, Robert Bryanton, with whom he sojourned occasionally at Ballymulvey
      House in the neighborhood. They used to make excursions about the country
      on foot, sometimes fishing, sometimes hunting otter in the Inny. They got
      up a country club at the little inn of Ballymahon, of which Goldsmith soon
      became the oracle and prime wit, astonishing his unlettered associates by
      his learning, and being considered capital at a song and a story. From the
      rustic conviviality of the inn at Ballymahon, and the company which used
      to assemble there, it is surmised that he took some hints in after life
      for his picturing of Tony Lumpkin and his associates: &ldquo;Dick Muggins,
      the exciseman; Jack Slang, the horse doctor; little Aminidab, that grinds
      the music-box, and Tom Twist, that spins the pewter platter.&rdquo; Nay,
      it is thought that Tony&rsquo;s drinking song at the Three Jolly Pigeons
      was but a revival of one of the convivial catches at Ballymahon:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Then come put the jorum about,
    And let us be merry and clever,
  Our hearts and our liquors are stout,
    Here&rsquo;s the Three Jolly Pigeons forever.
  Let some cry of woodcock or hare,
    Your bustards, your ducks, and your widgeons,
  But of all the gay birds in the air,
    Here&rsquo;s a health to the Three Jolly Pigeons.
  Toroddle, toroddle, toroll.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all these accomplishments and this rural popularity, his
      friends began to shake their heads and shrug their shoulders when they
      spoke of him; and his brother Henry noted with anything but satisfaction
      his frequent visits to the club at Ballymahon. He emerged, however,
      unscathed from this dangerous ordeal, more fortunate in this respect than
      his comrade Bryanton; but he retained throughout life a fondness for
      clubs; often, too, in the course of his checkered career, he looked back
      to this period of rural sports and careless enjoyments as one of the few
      sunny spots of his cloudy life; and though he ultimately rose to associate
      with birds of a finer feather, his heart would still yearn in secret after
      the THREE JOLLY PIGEONS.

      CHAPTER THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      GOLDSMITH REJECTED BY THE BISHOP&mdash;SECOND SALLY TO SEE THE WORLD&mdash;TAKES
      PASSAGE FOR AMERICA&mdash;SHIP SAILS WITHOUT HIM&mdash;RETURN ON
      FIDDLE-BACK&mdash;A HOSPITABLE FRIEND&mdash;THE COUNSELOR
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was now arrived for Goldsmith to apply for orders, and he
      presented himself accordingly before the Bishop of Elfin for ordination.
      We have stated his great objection to clerical life, the obligation to
      wear a black coat; and, whimsical as it may appear, dress seems in fact to
      have formed an obstacle to his entrance into the church. He had ever a
      passion for clothing his sturdy but awkward little person in gay colors;
      and on this solemn occasion, when it was to be supposed his garb would be
      of suitable gravity, he appeared luminously arrayed in scarlet breeches!
      He was rejected by the bishop; some say for want of sufficient studious
      preparation; his rambles and frolics with Bob Bryanton, and his revels
      with the club at Ballymahon, having been much in the way of his
      theological studies; others attribute his rejection to reports of his
      college irregularities, which the bishop had received from his old tryant
      Wilder; but those who look into the matter with more knowing eyes
      pronounce the scarlet breeches to have been the fundamental objection.
      &ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; says Goldsmith, speaking through his humorous
      representative, the &ldquo;Man in Black&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;my friends
      were now perfectly satisfied I was undone; and yet they thought it a pity
      for one that had not the least harm in him, and was so very good-natured.&rdquo;
      His uncle Contarine, however, still remained unwavering in his kindness,
      though much less sanguine in his expectations. He now looked round for a
      humbler sphere of action, and through his influence and exertions Oliver
      was received as tutor in the family of a Mr. Flinn, a gentleman of the
      neighborhood. The situation was apparently respectable; he had his seat at
      the table, and joined the family in their domestic recreations and their
      evening game at cards. There was a servility, however, in his position,
      which was not to his taste; nor did his deference for the family increase
      upon familiar intercourse. He charged a member of it with unfair play at
      cards. A violent altercation ensued, which ended in his throwing up his
      situation as tutor. On being paid off he found himself in possession of an
      unheard of amount of money. His wandering propensity and his desire to see
      the world were instantly in the ascendency. Without communicating his
      plans or intentions to his friends, he procured a good horse, and with
      thirty pounds in his pocket made his second sally forth into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy niece and housekeeper of the hero of La Mancha could not have
      been more surprised and dismayed at one of the Don&rsquo;s clandestine
      expeditions than were the mother and friends of Goldsmith when they heard
      of his mysterious departure. Weeks elapsed, and nothing was seen or heard
      of him. It was feared that he had left the country on one of his wandering
      freaks, and his poor mother was reduced almost to despair, when one day he
      arrived at her door almost as forlorn in plight as the prodigal son. Of
      his thirty pounds not a shilling was left; and instead of the goodly steed
      on which he had issued forth on his errantry, he was mounted on a sorry
      little pony, which he had nicknamed Fiddle-back. As soon as his mother was
      well assured of his safety, she rated him soundly for his inconsiderate
      conduct. His brothers and sisters, who were tenderly attached to him,
      interfered, and succeeded in mollifying her ire; and whatever lurking
      anger the good dame might have, was no doubt effectually vanquished by the
      following whimsical narrative which he drew up at his brother&rsquo;s
      house and dispatched to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mother, if you will sit down and calmly listen to what I
      say, you shall be fully resolved in every one of those many questions you
      have asked me. I went to Cork and converted my horse, which you prize so
      much higher than Fiddle-back, into cash, took my passage in a ship bound
      for America, and, at the same time, paid the captain for my freight and
      all the other expenses of my voyage. But it so happened that the wind did
      not answer for three weeks; and you know, mother, that I could not command
      the elements. My misfortune was that, when the wind served, I happened to
      be with a party in the country, and my friend the captain never inquired
      after me, but set sail with as much indifference as if I had been on
      board. The remainder of my time I employed in the city and its environs,
      viewing everything curious, and you know no one can starve while he has
      money in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reduced, however, to my last two guineas, I began to think of my
      dear mother and friends whom I had left behind me, and so bought that
      generous beast Fiddle-back, and bade adieu to Cork with only five
      shillings in my pocket. This, to be sure, was but a scanty allowance for
      man and horse toward a journey of above a hundred miles; but I did not
      despair, for I knew I must find friends on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recollected particularly an old and faithful acquaintance I made
      at college, who had often and earnestly pressed me to spend a summer with
      him, and he lived but eight miles from Cork. This circumstance of vicinity
      he would expatiate on to me with peculiar emphasis. &lsquo;We shall,&rsquo;
      says he, &lsquo;enjoy the delights of both city and country, and you shall
      command my stable and my purse.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, upon the way I met a poor woman all in tears, who told me
      her husband had been arrested for a debt he was not able to pay, and that
      his eight children must now starve, bereaved as they were of his industry,
      which had been their only support. I thought myself at home, being not far
      from my friend&rsquo;s house, and therefore parted with a moiety of all my
      store; and pray, mother, ought I not to have given her the other half
      crown, for what she got would be of little use to her? However, I soon
      arrived at the mansion of my affectionate friend, guarded by the vigilance
      of a huge mastiff, who flew at me and would have torn me to pieces but for
      the assistance of a woman, whose countenance was not less grim than that
      of the dog; yet she with great humanity relieved me from the jaws of this
      Cerberus, and was prevailed on to carry up my name to her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without suffering me to wait long, my old friend, who was then
      recovering from a severe fit of sickness, came down in his nightcap,
      night-gown, and slippers, and embraced me with the most cordial welcome,
      showed me in, and, after giving me a history of his indisposition, assured
      me that he considered himself peculiarly fortunate in having under his
      roof the man he most loved on earth, and whose stay with him must, above
      all things, contribute to perfect his recovery. I now repented sorely I
      had not given the poor woman the other half crown, as I thought all my
      bills of humanity would be punctually answered by this worthy man. I
      revealed to him my whole soul; I opened to him all my distresses; and
      freely owned that I had but one half crown in my pocket; but that now,
      like a ship after weathering out the storm, I considered myself secure in
      a safe and hospitable harbor. He made no answer, but walked about the
      room, rubbing his hands as one in deep study. This I imputed to the
      sympathetic feelings of a tender heart, which increased my esteem for him,
      and, as that increased, I gave the most favorable interpretation to his
      silence. I construed it into delicacy of sentiment, as if he dreaded to
      wound my pride by expressing his commiseration in words, leaving his
      generous conduct to speak for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It now approached six o&rsquo;clock in the evening; and as I had
      eaten no breakfast, and as my spirits were raised, my appetite for dinner
      grew uncommonly keen. At length the old woman came into the room with two
      plates, one spoon, and a dirty cloth, which she laid upon the table. This
      appearance, without increasing my spirits, did not diminish my appetite.
      My protectress soon returned with a small bowl of sago, a small porringer
      of sour milk, a loaf of stale brown bread, and the heel of an old cheese
      all over crawling with mites. My friend apologized that his illness
      obliged him to live on slops, and that better fare was not in the house;
      observing, at the same time, that a milk diet was certainly the most
      healthful; and at eight o&rsquo;clock he again recommended a regular life,
      declaring that for his part he would <i>lie down with the lamb and rise
      with the lark</i>. My hunger was at this time so exceedingly sharp that I
      wished for another slice of the loaf, but was obliged to go to bed without
      even that refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lenten entertainment I had received made me resolve to depart
      as soon as possible; accordingly, next morning, when I spoke of going, he
      did not oppose my resolution; he rather commended my design, adding some
      very sage counsel upon the occasion. &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; said he,
      &lsquo;the longer you stay away from your mother, the more you will grieve
      her and your other friends; and possibly they are already afflicted at
      hearing of this foolish expedition you have made.&rsquo; Notwithstanding
      all this, and without any hope of softening such a sordid heart, I again
      renewed the tale of my distress, and asking &lsquo;how he thought I could
      travel above a hundred miles upon one half crown?&rsquo; I begged to
      borrow a single guinea, which I assured him should be repaid with thanks.
      &lsquo;And you know, sir,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;it is no more than I have
      done for you.&rsquo; To which he firmly answered, &lsquo;Why, look you,
      Mr. Goldsmith, that is neither here nor there. I have paid you all you
      ever lent me, and this sickness of mine has left me bare of cash. But I
      have bethought myself of a conveyance for you; sell your horse, and I will
      furnish you a much better one to ride on.&rsquo; I readily grasped at his
      proposal, and begged to see the nag; on which he led me to his bedchamber,
      and from under the bed he pulled out a stout oak stick. &lsquo;Here he is,&rsquo;
      said he; &lsquo;take this in your hand, and it will carry you to your
      mother&rsquo;s with more safety than such a horse as you ride.&rsquo; I
      was in doubt, when I got it into my hand, whether I should not, in the
      first place, apply it to his pate; but a rap at the street door made the
      wretch fly to it, and when I returned to the parlor, he introduced me, as
      if nothing of the kind had happened, to the gentleman who entered, as Mr.
      Goldsmith, his most ingenious and worthy friend, of whom he had so often
      heard him speak with rapture. I could scarcely compose myself, and must
      have betrayed indignation in my mien to the stranger, who was a
      counselor-at-law in the neighborhood, a man of engaging aspect and polite
      address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After spending an hour, he asked my friend and me to dine with him
      at his house. This I declined at first, as I wished to have no further
      communication with my hospitable friend; but at the solicitation of both I
      at last consented, determined as I was by two motives: one, that I was
      prejudiced in favor of the looks and manner of the counselor; and the
      other, that I stood in need of a comfortable dinner. And there, indeed, I
      found everything that I could wish, abundance without profusion and
      elegance without affectation. In the evening, when my old friend, who had
      eaten very plentifully at his neighbor&rsquo;s table, but talked again of
      lying down with the lamb, made a motion to me for retiring, our generous
      host requested I should take a bed with him, upon which I plainly told my
      old friend that he might go home and take care of the horse he had given
      me, but that I should never re-enter his doors. He went away with a laugh,
      leaving me to add this to the other little things the counselor already
      knew of his plausible neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear mother, I found sufficient to reconcile me to all
      my follies; for here I spent three whole days. The counselor had two sweet
      girls to his daughters, who played enchantingly on the harpsichord; and
      yet it was but a melancholy pleasure I felt the first time I heard them;
      for that being the first time also that either of them had touched the
      instrument since their mother&rsquo;s death, I saw the tears in silence
      trickle down their father&rsquo;s cheeks. I every day endeavored to go
      away, but every day was pressed and obliged to stay. On my going, the
      counselor offered me his purse, with a horse and servant to convey me
      home; but the latter I declined, and only took a guinea to bear my
      necessary expenses on the road.

      amuse his mother and soften her vexation; but even in these respects it is
      valuable as showing the early play of his humor, and his happy knack of

      OF TOADYISM&mdash;A POET&rsquo;S PURSE FOR A CONTINENTAL TOUR
    </p>
    <p>
      A new consultation was held among Goldsmith&rsquo;s friends as to his
      future course, and it was determined he should try the law. His uncle
      Contarine agreed to advance the necessary funds, and actually furnished
      him with fifty pounds, with which he set off for London, to enter on his
      studies at the Temple. Unfortunately, he fell in company at Dublin with a
      Roscommon acquaintance, one whose wits had been sharpened about town, who
      beguiled him into a gambling-house, and soon left him as penniless as when
      he bestrode the redoubtable Fiddle-back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so ashamed of this fresh instance of gross heedlessness and
      imprudence that he remained some time in Dublin without communicating to
      his friends his destitute condition. They heard of it, however, and he was
      invited back to the country, and indulgently forgiven by his generous
      uncle, but less readily by his mother, who was mortified and disheartened
      at seeing all her early hopes of him so repeatedly blighted. His brother
      Henry, too, began to lose patience at these successive failures, resulting
      from thoughtless indiscretion; and a quarrel took place, which for some
      time interrupted their usually affectionate intercourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only home where poor erring Goldsmith still received a welcome was the
      parsonage of his affectionate, forgiving uncle. Here he used to talk of
      literature with the good, simple-hearted man, and delight him and his
      daughter with his verses. Jane, his early playmate, was now the woman
      grown; their intercourse was of a more intellectual kind than formerly;
      they discoursed of poetry and music; she played on the harpsichord, and he
      accompanied her with his flute. The music may not have been very artistic,
      as he never performed but by ear; it had probably as much merit as the
      poetry, which, if we may judge by the following specimen, was as yet but
      juvenile:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  TO A YOUNG LADY ON VALENTINE&rsquo;S DAY

      WITH THE DRAWING OF A HEART

    With submission at your shrine,
    Comes a heart your Valentine;
    From the side where once it grew,
    See it panting flies to you.
    Take it, fair one, to your breast,
    Soothe the fluttering thing to rest;
    Let the gentle, spotless toy,
    Be your sweetest, greatest joy;
    Every night when wrapp&rsquo;d in sleep,
    Next your heart the conquest keep.
    Or if dreams your fancy move,
    Hear it whisper me and love;
    Then in pity to the swain,
    Who must heartless else remain,
    Soft as gentle dewy show&rsquo;rs,
    Slow descend on April flow&rsquo;rs;
    Soft as gentle riv&rsquo;lets glide,
    Steal unnoticed to my side;
    If the gem you have to spare,
    Take your own and place it there.
</pre>
    <p>
      If this valentine was intended for the fair Jane, and expressive of a
      tender sentiment indulged by the stripling poet, it was unavailing, as not
      long afterward she was married to a Mr. Lawder. We trust, however, it was
      but a poetical passion of that transient kind which grows up in idleness
      and exhales itself in rhyme. While Oliver was thus piping and poetizing at
      the parsonage, his uncle Contarine received a visit from Dean Goldsmith of
      Cloyne; a kind of magnate in the wide but improvident family connection,
      throughout which his word was law and almost gospel. This august dignitary
      was pleased to discover signs of talent in Oliver, and suggested that as
      he had attempted divinity and law without success, he should now try
      physic. The advice came from too important a source to be disregarded, and
      it was determined to send him to Edinburgh to commence his studies. The
      Dean having given the advice, added to it, we trust, his blessing, but no
      money; that was furnished from the scantier purses of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      brother, his sister (Mrs. Hodson), and his ever-ready uncle, Contarine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the autumn of 1752 that Goldsmith arrived in Edinburgh. His
      outset in that city came near adding to the list of his indiscretions and
      disasters. Having taken lodgings at haphazard, he left his trunk there,
      containing all his worldly effects, and sallied forth to see the town.
      After sauntering about the streets until a late hour, he thought of
      returning home, when, to his confusion, he found he had not acquainted
      himself with the name either of his landlady or of the street in which she
      lived. Fortunately, in the height of his whimsical perplexity, he met the
      cawdy or porter who had carried his trunk, and who now served him as a
      guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not remain long in the lodgings in which he had put up. The hostess
      was too adroit at that hocus-pocus of the table which often is practiced
      in cheap boarding-houses. No one could conjure a single joint through a
      greater variety of forms. A loin of mutton, according to Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      account, would serve him and two fellow-students a whole week. &ldquo;A
      brandered chop was served up one day, a fried steak another, collops with
      onion sauce a third, and so on until the fleshy parts were quite consumed,
      when finally a dish of broth was manufactured from the bones on the
      seventh day, and the landlady rested from her labors.&rdquo; Goldsmith had
      a good-humored mode of taking things, and for a short time amused himself
      with the shifts and expedients of his landlady, which struck him in a
      ludicrous manner; he soon, however, fell in with fellow-students from his
      own country, whom he joined at more eligible quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now attended medical lectures, and attached himself to an association
      of students called the Medical Society. He set out, as usual, with the
      best intentions, but, as usual, soon fell into idle, convivial,
      thoughtless habits. Edinburgh was indeed a place of sore trial for one of
      his temperament. Convivial meetings were all the vogue, and the tavern was
      the universal rallying-place of good-fellowship. And then Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      intimacies lay chiefly among the Irish students, who were always ready for
      a wild freak and frolic. Among them he was a prime favorite and somewhat
      of a leader, from his exuberance of spirits, his vein of humor, and his
      talent at singing an Irish song and telling an Irish story.
    </p>
    <p>
      His usual carelessness in money matters attended him. Though his supplies
      from home were scanty and irregular, he never could bring himself into
      habits of prudence and economy; often he was stripped of all his present
      finances at play; often he lavished them away in fits of unguarded charity
      or generosity. Sometimes among his boon companions he assumed a ludicrous
      swagger in money matters, which no one afterward was more ready than
      himself to laugh at. At a convivial meeting with a number of his
      fellow-students, he suddenly proposed to draw lots with any one present
      which of the two should treat the whole party to the play. The moment the
      proposition had bolted from his lips his heart was in his throat. &ldquo;To
      my great though secret joy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they all declined the
      challenge. Had it been accepted, and had I proved the loser, a part of my
      wardrobe must have been pledged in order to raise the money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At another of these meetings there was an earnest dispute on the question
      of ghosts, some being firm believers in the possibility of departed
      spirits returning to visit their friends and familiar haunts. One of the
      disputants set sail the next day for London, but the vessel put back
      through the stress of weather. His return was unknown except to one of the
      believers in ghosts, who concerted with him a trick to be played off on
      the opposite party. In the evening, at a meeting of the students, the
      discussion was renewed; and one of the most strenuous opposers of ghosts
      was asked whether he considered himself proof against ocular
      demonstration? He persisted in his scoffing. Some solemn process of
      conjuration was performed, and the comrade supposed to be on his way to
      London made his appearance. The effect was fatal. The unbeliever fainted
      at the sight, and ultimately went mad. We have no account of what share
      Goldsmith took in this transaction, at which he was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter to his friend Bryanton contains some of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      impressions concerning Scotland and its inhabitants, and gives indications
      of that humor which characterized some of his later writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Robert Bryanton, at Ballymahon, Ireland</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;EDINBURGH, September 26, 1753.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR BOB&mdash;How many good excuses (and you know I was ever
      good at an excuse) might I call up to vindicate my past shameful silence.
      I might tell how I wrote a long letter on my first coming hither, and seem
      vastly angry at my not receiving an answer; I might allege that business
      (with business you know I was always pestered) had never given me time to
      finger a pen. But I suppress those and twenty more as plausible, and as
      easily invented, since they might be attended with a slight inconvenience
      of being known to be lies. Let me then speak truth. An hereditary
      indolence (I have it from the mother&rsquo;s side) has hitherto prevented
      my writing to you, and still prevents my writing at least twenty-five
      letters more, due to my friends in Ireland. No turn-spit-dog gets up into
      his wheel with more reluctance than I sit down to write; yet no dog ever
      loved the roast meat he turns better than I do him I now address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet what shall I say now I am entered? Shall I tire you with a
      description of this unfruitful country; where I must lead you over their
      hills all brown with heath, or their valleys scarcely able to feed a
      rabbit? Man alone seems to be the only creature who has arrived to the
      natural size in this poor soil. Every part of the country presents the
      same dismal landscape. No grove, nor brook, lend their music to cheer the
      stranger, or make the inhabitants forget their poverty. Yet with all these
      disadvantages to call him down to humility, a Scotchman is one of the
      proudest things alive. The poor have pride ever ready to relieve them. If
      mankind should happen to despise them, they are masters of their own
      admiration, and that they can plentifully bestow upon themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From their pride and poverty, as I take it, results one advantage
      this country enjoys&mdash;namely, the gentlemen here are much better bred
      than among us. No such character here as our fox-hunters; and they have
      expressed great surprise when I informed them that some men in Ireland of
      one thousand pounds a year spend their whole lives in running after a
      hare, and drinking to be drunk. Truly if such a being, equipped in his
      hunting dress, came among a circle of Scotch gentry, they would behold him
      with the same astonishment that a countryman does King George on
      horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men here have generally high cheek bones, and are lean and
      swarthy, fond of action, dancing in particular. Now that I have mentioned
      dancing, let me say something of their balls, which are very frequent
      here. When a stranger enters the dancing-hall, he sees one end of the room
      taken up by the ladies, who sit dismally in a group by themselves; in the
      other end stand their pensive partners that are to be; but no more
      intercourse between the sexes than there is between two countries at war.
      The ladies indeed may ogle, and the gentlemen sigh; but an embargo is laid
      on any closer commerce. At length, to interrupt hostilities, the lady
      directress, or intendant, or what you will, pitches upon a lady and
      gentleman to walk a minuet; which they perform with a formality that
      approaches to despondence. After five or six couple have thus walked the
      gantlet, all stand up to country dances; each gentleman furnished with a
      partner from the aforesaid lady directress; so they dance much, say
      nothing, and thus concludes our assembly. I told a Scotch gentleman that
      such profound silence resembled the ancient procession of the Roman
      matrons in honor of Ceres; and the Scotch gentleman told me (and, faith, I
      believe he was right) that I was a very great pedant for my pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am come to the ladies; and to show that I love Scotland, and
      everything that belongs to so charming a country, I insist on it, and will
      give him leave to break my head that denies it&mdash;that the Scotch
      ladies are ten thousand times finer and handsomer than the Irish. To be
      sure, now, I see your sisters Betty and Peggy vastly surprised at my
      partiality&mdash;but tell them flatly, I don&rsquo;t value them&mdash;or
      their fine skins, or eyes, or good sense, or&mdash;&mdash;, a potato;&mdash;for
      I say, and will maintain it; and as a convincing proof (I am in a great
      passion) of what I assert, the Scotch ladies say it themselves. But to be
      less serious; where will you find a language so prettily become a pretty
      mouth as the broad Scotch? And the women here speak it in its highest
      purity; for instance, teach one of your young ladies at home to pronounce
      the &lsquo;Whoar wull I gong?&rsquo; with a becoming widening of mouth,
      and I&rsquo;ll lay my life they&rsquo;ll wound every hearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no such character here as a coquette, but alas! how many
      envious prudes! Some days ago I walked into my Lord Kilcoubry&rsquo;s (don&rsquo;t
      be surprised, my lord is but a glover), [Footnote: William Maclellan, who
      claimed the title, and whose son succeeded in establishing the claim in
      1773. The father is said to have voted at the election of the sixteen
      Peers for Scotland, and to have sold gloves in the lobby at this and other
      public assemblages.] when the Duchess of Hamilton (that fair who
      sacrificed her beauty to her ambition, and her inward peace to a title and
      gilt equipage) passed by in her chariot; her battered husband, or more
      properly the guardian of her charms, sat by her side. Straight envy began,
      in the shape of no less than three ladies who sat with me, to find faults
      in her faultless form.&mdash;&lsquo;For my part,&rsquo; says the first,
      &lsquo;I think what I always thought, that the duchess has too much of the
      red in her complexion.&rsquo; &lsquo;Madam, I am of your opinion,&rsquo;
      says the second; &lsquo;I think her face has a palish cast too much on the
      delicate order.&rsquo; &lsquo;And let me tell you,&rsquo; added the third
      lady, whose mouth was puckered up to the size of an issue, &lsquo;that the
      duchess has fine lips, but she wants a mouth.&rsquo;&mdash;At this every
      lady drew up her mouth as if going to pronounce the letter P.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how ill, my Bob, does it become me to ridicule women with whom
      I have scarcely any correspondence! There are, &rsquo;tis certain,
      handsome women here; and &rsquo;tis certain they have handsome men to keep
      them company. An ugly and poor man is society only for himself, and such
      society the world lets me enjoy in great abundance. Fortune has given you
      circumstances, and nature a person to look charming in the eyes of the
      fair. Nor do I envy my dear Bob such blessings, while I may sit down and
      laugh at the world and at myself&mdash;the most ridiculous object in it.
      But you see I am grown downright splenetic, and perhaps the fit may
      continue till I receive an answer to this. I know you cannot send me much
      news from Ballymahon, but such as it is, send it all; everything you send
      will be agreeable to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has George Conway put up a sign yet; or John Binley left off
      drinking drams; or Tom Allen got a new wig? But I leave you to your own
      choice what to write. While I live, know you have a true friend in yours,
      etc., etc.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Give my sincere respects (not compliments, do you mind)
      to your agreeable family, and give my service to my mother, if you see
      her; for, as you express it in Ireland, I have a sneaking kindness for her
      still. Direct to me, &mdash;&mdash;, Student in Physic, in Edinburgh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing worthy of preservation appeared from his pen during his residence
      in Edinburgh; and indeed his poetical powers, highly as they had been
      estimated by his friends, had not as yet produced anything of superior
      merit. He made on one occasion a month&rsquo;s excursion to the Highlands.
      &ldquo;I set out the first day on foot,&rdquo; says he, in a letter to his
      uncle Contarine, &ldquo;but an ill-natured corn I have on my toe has for
      the future prevented that cheap mode of traveling; so the second day I
      hired a horse about the size of a ram, and he walked away (trot he could
      not) as pensive as his master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During his residence in Scotland his convivial talents gained him at one
      time attentions in a high quarter, which, however, he had the good sense
      to appreciate correctly. &ldquo;I have spent,&rdquo; says he, in one of
      his letters, &ldquo;more than a fortnight every second day at the Duke of
      Hamilton&rsquo;s; but it seems they like me more as a jester than as a
      companion, so I disdained so servile an employment as unworthy my calling
      as a physician.&rdquo; Here we again find the origin of another passage in
      his autobiography, under the character of the &ldquo;Man in Black,&rdquo;
      wherein that worthy figures as a flatterer to a great man. &ldquo;At
      first,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I was surprised that the situation of a
      flatterer at a great man&rsquo;s table could be thought disagreeable;
      there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship
      spoke, and laughing when he looked round for applause. This, even good
      manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too soon, his
      lordship was a greater dunce than myself, and from that moment flattery
      was at an end. I now rather aimed at setting him right, than at receiving
      his absurdities with submission: to flatter those we do not know is an
      easy task; but to flatter our intimate acquaintances, all whose foibles
      are strongly in our eyes, is drudgery insupportable. Every time I now
      opened my lips in praise, my falsehood went to my conscience; his lordship
      soon perceived me to be very unfit for his service: I was therefore
      discharged; my patron at the same time being graciously pleased to observe
      that he believed I was tolerably good-natured, and had not the least harm
      in me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After spending two winters at Edinburgh, Goldsmith prepared to finish his
      medical studies on the Continent, for which his uncle Contarine agreed to
      furnish the funds. &ldquo;I intend,&rdquo; said he, in a letter to his
      uncle, &ldquo;to visit Paris, where the great Farheim, Petit, and Du
      Hammel de Monceau instruct their pupils in all the branches of medicine.
      They speak French, and consequently I shall have much the advantage of
      most of my countrymen, as I am perfectly acquainted with that language,
      and few who leave Ireland are so. I shall spend the spring and summer in
      Paris, and the beginning of next winter go to Leyden. The great Albinus is
      still alive there, and &rsquo;twill be proper to go, though only to have
      it said that we have studied in so famous a university.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I shall not have another opportunity of receiving money from
      your bounty till my return to Ireland, so I have drawn for the last sum
      that I hope I shall ever trouble you for; &rsquo;tis £20. And now, dear
      sir, let me here acknowledge the humility of the station in which you
      found me; let me tell how I was despised by most, and hateful to myself.
      Poverty, hopeless poverty, was my lot, and Melancholy was beginning to
      make me her own. When you&mdash;but I stop here, to inquire how your
      health goes on? How does my cousin Jenny, and has she recovered her late
      complaint? How does my poor Jack Goldsmith? I fear his disorder is of such
      a nature as he won&rsquo;t easily recover. I wish, my dear sir, you would
      make me happy by another letter before I go abroad, for there I shall
      hardly hear from you.... Give my&mdash;how shall I express it? Give my
      earnest love to Mr. and Mrs. Lawder.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lawder was Jane, his early playmate&mdash;the object of his valentine&mdash;his
      first poetical inspiration. She had been for some time married.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical instruction, it will be perceived, was the ostensible motive for
      this visit to the Continent, but the real one, in all probability, was his
      long-cherished desire to see foreign parts. This, however, he would not
      acknowledge even to himself, but sought to reconcile his roving
      propensities with some grand moral purpose. &ldquo;I esteem the traveler
      who instructs the heart,&rdquo; says he, in one of his subsequent
      writings, &ldquo;but despise him who only indulges the imagination. A man
      who leaves home to mend himself and others is a philosopher; but he who
      goes from country to country, guided by the blind impulse of curiosity, is
      only a vagabond.&rdquo; He, of course, was to travel as a philosopher, and
      in truth his outfits for a continental tour were in character. &ldquo;I
      shall carry just £33 to France,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with good store of
      clothes, shirts, etc., and that with economy will suffice.&rdquo; He
      forgot to make mention of his flute, which it will be found had
      occasionally to come in play when economy could not replenish his purse,
      nor philosophy find him a supper. Thus slenderly provided with money,
      prudence, or experience, and almost as slightly guarded against &ldquo;hard
      knocks&rdquo; as the hero of La Mancha, whose head-piece was half iron,
      half pasteboard, he made his final sally forth upon the world; hoping all
      things; believing all things; little anticipating the checkered ills in
      store for him; little thinking when he penned his valedictory letter to
      his good uncle Contarine that he was never to see him more; never to
      return after all his wandering to the friend of his infancy; never to
      revisit his early and fondly-remembered haunts at &ldquo;sweet Lissoy&rdquo;
      and Ballymahon.

      THE AGREEABLE FELLOW-PASSENGERS&mdash;RISKS FROM FRIENDS PICKED UP BY THE
      WAYSIDE&mdash;SKETCHES OF HOLLAND AND THE DUTCH&mdash;SHIFTS WHILE A POOR
      STUDENT AT LEYDEN&mdash;THE TULIP SPECULATION&mdash;THE PROVIDENT FLUTE&mdash;SOJOURN
      AT PARIS&mdash;SKETCH OF VOLTAIRE&mdash;TRAVELING SHIFTS OF A PHILOSOPHIC
      VAGABOND
    </p>
    <p>
      His usual indiscretion attended Goldsmith at the very outset of his
      foreign enterprise. He had intended to take shipping at Leith for Holland,
      but on arriving at that port he found a ship about to sail for Bordeaux,
      with six agreeable passengers, whose acquaintance he had probably made at
      the inn. He was not a man to resist a sudden impulse; so, instead of
      embarking for Holland, he found himself plowing the seas on his way to the
      other side of the Continent. Scarcely had the ship been two days at sea
      when she was driven by stress of weather to Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Here
      &ldquo;of course&rdquo; Goldsmith and his agreeable fellow-passengers
      found it expedient to go on shore and &ldquo;refresh themselves after the
      fatigues of the voyage.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of course&rdquo; they frolicked and
      made merry until a late hour in the evening, when, in the midst of their
      hilarity, the door was burst open, and a sergeant and twelve grenadiers
      entered with fixed bayonets, and took the whole convivial party prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that the agreeable companions with whom our greenhorn had struck
      up such a sudden intimacy were Scotchmen in the French service, who had
      been in Scotland enlisting recruits for the French army.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain Goldsmith protested his innocence; he was marched off with his
      fellow-revelers to prison, whence he with difficulty obtained his release
      at the end of a fortnight. With his customary facility, however, at
      palliating his misadventures, he found everything turn out for the best.
      His imprisonment saved his life, for during his detention the ship
      proceeded on her voyage, but was wrecked at the mouth of the Garonne, and
      all on board perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s second embarkation was for Holland direct, and in nine
      days he arrived at Rotterdam, whence he proceeded, without any more
      deviations, to Leyden. He gives a whimsical picture, in one of his
      letters, of the appearance of the Hollanders. &ldquo;The modern Dutchman
      is quite a different creature from him of former times; he in everything
      imitates a Frenchman but in his easy, disengaged air. He is vastly
      ceremonious, and is, perhaps, exactly what a Frenchman might have been in
      the reign of Louis XIV. Such are the better bred. But the downright
      Hollander is one of the oddest figures in nature. Upon a lank head of hair
      he wears a half-cocked narrow hat, laced with black ribbon; no coat, but
      seven waistcoats and nine pair of breeches, so that his hips reach up
      almost to his armpits. This well-clothed vegetable is now fit to see
      company or make love. But what a pleasing creature is the object of his
      appetite! why, she wears a large fur cap, with a deal of Flanders lace;
      and for every pair of breeches he carries, she puts on two petticoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Dutch lady burns nothing about her phlegmatic admirer but his
      tobacco. You must know, sir, every woman carries in her hand a stove of
      coals, which, when she sits, she snugs under her petticoats, and at this
      chimney dozing Strephon lights his pipe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same letter, he contrasts Scotland and Holland. &ldquo;There hills
      and rocks intercept every prospect; here it is all a continued plain.
      There you might see a well-dressed duchess issuing from a dirty close, and
      here a dirty Dutchman inhabiting a palace. The Scotch may be compared to a
      tulip, planted in dung; but I can never see a Dutchman in his own house
      but I think of a magnificent Egyptian temple dedicated to an ox.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The country itself awakened his admiration. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;can equal its beauty; wherever I turn my eyes, fine houses,
      elegant gardens, statues, grottoes, vistas, present themselves; but when
      you enter their towns you are charmed beyond description. No misery is to
      be seen here; every one is usefully employed.&rdquo; And again, in his
      noble description in The Traveler:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To men of other minds my fancy flies,
  Imbosom&rsquo;d in the deep where Holland lies.
  Methinks her patient sons before me stand,
  Where the broad ocean leans against the land,
  And, sedulous to stop the coming tide,
  Lift the tall rampire&rsquo;s artificial pride.
  Onward, methinks, and diligently slow,
  The firm connected bulwark seems to grow;
  Spreads its long arms amid the watery roar,
  Scoops out an empire, and usurps the shore.
  While the pent ocean, rising o&rsquo;er the pile,
  Sees an amphibious world before him smile;
  The slow canal, the yellow blossom&rsquo;d vale,
  The willow-tufted bank, the gliding sail,
  The crowded mart, the cultivated plain,
  A new creation rescued from his reign.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      He remained about a year at Leyden, attending the lectures of Gaubius on
      chemistry and Albinus on anatomy; though his studies are said to have been
      miscellaneous, and directed to literature rather than science. The
      thirty-three pounds with which he had set out on his travels were soon
      consumed, and he was put to many a shift to meet his expenses until his
      precarious remittances should arrive. He had a good friend on these
      occasions in a fellow-student and countryman, named Ellis, who afterward
      rose to eminence as a physician. He used frequently to loan small sums to
      Goldsmith, which were always scrupulously paid. Ellis discovered the
      innate merits of the poor awkward student, and used to declare in after
      life that &ldquo;it was a common remark in Leyden, that in all the
      peculiarities of Goldsmith, an elevation of mind was to be noted; a
      philosophical tone and manner; the feelings of a gentleman, and the
      language and information of a scholar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, in his emergencies, Goldsmith undertook to teach the English
      language. It is true he was ignorant of the Dutch, but he had a smattering
      of the French, picked up among the Irish priests at Ballymahon. He depicts
      his whimsical embarrassment in this respect, in his account in the Vicar
      of Wakefield of the <i>philosophical vagabond</i> who went to Holland to
      teach the natives English, without knowing a word of their own language.
      Sometimes, when sorely pinched, and sometimes, perhaps, when flush, he
      resorted to the gambling tables, which in those days abounded in Holland.
      His good friend Ellis repeatedly warned him against this unfortunate
      propensity, but in vain. It brought its own cure, or rather its own
      punishment, by stripping him of every shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellis once more stepped in to his relief with a true Irishman&rsquo;s
      generosity, but with more considerateness than generally characterizes an
      Irishman, for he only granted pecuniary aid on condition of his quitting
      the sphere of danger. Goldsmith gladly consented to leave Holland, being
      anxious to visit other parts. He intended to proceed to Paris and pursue
      his studies there, and was furnished by his friend with money for the
      journey. Unluckily, he rambled into the garden of a florist just before
      quitting Leyden. The tulip mania was still prevalent in Holland, and some
      species of that splendid flower brought immense prices. In wandering
      through the garden Goldsmith recollected that his uncle Contarine was a
      tulip fancier. The thought suddenly struck him that here was an
      opportunity of testifying, in a delicate manner, his sense of that
      generous uncle&rsquo;s past kindnesses. In an instant his hand was in his
      pocket; a number of choice and costly tulip-roots were purchased and
      packed up for Mr. Contarine; and it was not until he had paid for them
      that he bethought himself that he had spent all the money borrowed for his
      traveling expenses. Too proud, however, to give up his journey, and too
      shamefaced to make another appeal to his friend&rsquo;s liberality, he
      determined to travel on foot, and depend upon chance and good luck for the
      means of getting forward; and it is said that he actually set off on a
      tour of the Continent, in February, 1775, with but one spare shirt, a
      flute, and a single guinea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed,&rdquo; says one of his biographers, &ldquo;with a good
      constitution, an adventurous spirit, and with that thoughtless, or,
      perhaps, happy disposition which takes no care for to-morrow, he continued
      his travels for a long time in spite of innumerable privations.&rdquo; In
      his amusing narrative of the adventures of a &ldquo;Philosophic Vagabond&rdquo;
      in the Vicar of Wakefield, we find shadowed out the expedients he pursued.
      &ldquo;I had some knowledge of music, with a tolerable voice; I now turned
      what was once my amusement into a present means of subsistence. I passed
      among the harmless peasants of Flanders, and among such of the French as
      were poor enough to be very merry, for I ever found them sprightly in
      proportion to their wants. Whenever I approached a peasant&rsquo;s house
      toward nightfall, I played one of my merriest tunes, and that procured me
      not only a lodging, but subsistence for the next day; but in truth I must
      own, whenever I attempted to entertain persons of a higher rank, they
      always thought my performance odious, and never made me any return for my
      endeavors to please them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Paris he attended the chemical lectures of Rouelle, then in great
      vogue, where he says he witnessed as bright a circle of beauty as graced
      the court of Versailles. His love of theatricals, also, led him to attend
      the performances of the celebrated actress Mademoiselle Clairon, with
      which he was greatly delighted. He seems to have looked upon the state of
      society with the eye of a philosopher, but to have read the signs of the
      times with the prophetic eye of a poet. In his rambles about the environs
      of Paris he was struck with the immense quantities of game running about
      almost in a tame state; and saw in those costly and rigid preserves for
      the amusement and luxury of the privileged few a sure &ldquo;badge of the
      slavery of the people.&rdquo; This slavery he predicted was drawing toward
      a close. &ldquo;When I consider that these parliaments, the members of
      which are all created by the court, and the presidents of which can only
      act by immediate direction, presume even to mention privileges and
      freedom, who till of late received directions from the throne with
      implicit humility; when this is considered, I cannot help fancying that
      the genius of Freedom has entered that kingdom in disguise. If they have
      but three weak monarchs more successively on the throne, the mask will be
      laid aside and the country will certainly once more be free.&rdquo; Events
      have testified to the sage forecast of the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a brief sojourn in Paris he appears to have gained access to
      valuable society, and to have had the honor and pleasure of making the
      acquaintance of Voltaire; of whom, in after years, he wrote a memoir.
      &ldquo;As a companion,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;no man ever exceeded him
      when he pleased to lead the conversation; which, however, was not always
      the case. In company which he either disliked or despised, few could be
      more reserved than he; but when he was warmed in discourse, and got over a
      hesitating manner, which sometimes he was subject to, it was rapture to
      hear him. His meager visage seemed insensibly to gather beauty; every
      muscle in it had meaning, and his eye beamed with unusual brightness. The
      person who writes this memoir,&rdquo; continues he, &ldquo;remembers to
      have seen him in a select company of wits of both sexes at Paris, when the
      subject happened to turn upon English taste and learning. Fontenelle (then
      nearly a hundred years old), who was of the party, and who being
      unacquainted with the language or authors of the country he undertook to
      condemn, with a spirit truly vulgar began to revile both. Diderot, who
      liked the English, and knew something of their literary pretensions,
      attempted to vindicate their poetry and learning, but with unequal
      abilities. The company quickly perceived that Fontenelle was superior in
      the dispute, and were surprised at the silence which Voltaire had
      preserved all the former part of the night, particularly as the
      conversation happened to turn upon one of his favorite topics. Fontenelle
      continued his triumph until about twelve o&rsquo;clock, when Voltaire
      appeared at last roused from his reverie. His whole frame seemed animated.
      He began his defense with the utmost defiance mixed with spirit, and now
      and then let fall the finest strokes of raillery upon his antagonist; and
      his harangue lasted till three in the morning. I must confess that,
      whether from national partiality or from the elegant sensibility of his
      manner, I never was so charmed, nor did I ever remember so absolute a
      victory as he gained in this dispute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s ramblings took him into Germany and Switzerland, from
      which last mentioned country he sent to his brother in Ireland the first
      brief sketch, afterward amplified into his poem of The Traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Geneva he became traveling tutor to a mongrel young gentleman, son of a
      London pawnbroker, who had been suddenly elevated into fortune and
      absurdity by the death of an uncle. The youth, before setting up for a
      gentleman, had been an attorney&rsquo;s apprentice, and was an arrant
      pettifogger in money matters. Never were two beings more illy assorted
      than he and Goldsmith. We may form an idea of the tutor and the pupil from
      the following extract from the narrative of the &ldquo;Philosophic
      Vagabond.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was to be the young gentleman&rsquo;s governor, but with a
      proviso that he should always be permitted to govern himself. My pupil, in
      fact, understood the art of guiding in money concerns much better than I.
      He was heir to a fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds, left him by
      an uncle in the West Indies; and his guardians, to qualify him for the
      management of it, had bound him apprentice to an attorney. Thus avarice
      was his prevailing passion; all his questions on the road were how money
      might be saved&mdash;which was the least expensive course of travel&mdash;whether
      anything could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again
      in London. Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he was
      ready enough to look at; but if the sight of them was to be paid for, he
      usually asserted that he had been told that they were not worth seeing. He
      never paid a bill that he would not observe how amazingly expensive
      traveling was; and all this though not yet twenty-one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this sketch Goldsmith undoubtedly shadows forth his annoyances as
      traveling tutor to this concrete young gentleman, compounded of the
      pawnbroker, the pettifogger, and the West Indian heir, with an overlaying
      of the city miser. They had continual difficulties on all points of
      expense until they reached Marseilles, where both were glad to separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more on foot, but freed from the irksome duties of &ldquo;bear
      leader,&rdquo; and with some of his pay, as tutor, in his pocket,
      Goldsmith continued his half-vagrant peregrinations through part of France
      and Piedmont, and some of the Italian States. He had acquired, as has been
      shown, a habit of shifting along and living by expedients, and a new one
      presented itself in Italy. &ldquo;My skill in music,&rdquo; says he, in
      the &ldquo;Philosophic Vagabond,&rdquo; &ldquo;could avail me nothing in a
      country where every peasant was a better musician than I; but by this time
      I had acquired another talent, which answered my purpose as well, and this
      was a skill in disputation. In all the foreign universities and convents
      there are, upon certain days, philosophical theses maintained against
      every adventitious disputant; for which, if the champion opposes with any
      dexterity, he can claim a gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one
      night.&rdquo; Though a poor wandering scholar, his reception in these
      learned piles was as free from humiliation as in the cottages of the
      peasantry. &ldquo;With the members of these establishments,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;I could converse on topics of literature, <i>and then I always
      forgot the meanness of my circumstances</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At Padua, where he remained some months, he is said to have taken his
      medical degree. It is probable he was brought to a pause in this city by
      the death of his uncle Contarine, who had hitherto assisted him in his
      wanderings by occasional, though, of course, slender remittances. Deprived
      of this source of supplies he wrote to his friends in Ireland, and
      especially to his brother-in-law Hodson, describing his destitute
      situation. His letters brought him neither money nor reply. It appears
      from subsequent correspondence that his brother-in-law actually exerted
      himself to raise a subscription for his assistance among his relatives,
      friends, and acquaintance, but without success. Their faith and hope in
      him were most probably at an end; as yet he had disappointed them at every
      point, he had given none of the anticipated proofs of talent, and they
      were too poor to support what they may have considered the wandering
      propensities of a heedless spendthrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus left to his own precarious resources, Goldsmith gave up all further
      wandering in Italy, without visiting the south, though Rome and Naples
      must have held out powerful attractions to one of his poetical cast. Once
      more resuming his pilgrim staff, he turned his face toward England,
      &ldquo;walking along from city to city, examining mankind more nearly, and
      seeing both sides of the picture.&rdquo; In traversing France his flute&mdash;his
      magic flute&mdash;was once more in requisition, as we may conclude, by the
      following passage in his Traveler:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Gay, sprightly land of mirth and social ease,
  Pleased with thyself, whom all the world can please,
  How often have I led thy sportive choir
  With tuneless pipe beside the murmuring Loire!
  Where shading elms along the margin grew,
  And freshened from the wave the zephyr flew;
  And haply though my harsh note falt&rsquo;ring still,
  But mocked all tune, and marr&rsquo;d the dancer&rsquo;s skill;
  Yet would the village praise my wondrous power,
  And dance forgetful of the noontide hour.
  Alike all ages: Dames of ancient days
  Have led their children through the mirthful maze,
  And the gay grandsire, skill&rsquo;d in gestic lore,
  Has frisk&rsquo;d beneath the burden of threescore.&rdquo;

      LANDING IN ENGLAND&mdash;SHIFTS OF A MAN WITHOUT MONEY&mdash;THE PESTLE
      AND MORTAR&mdash;THEATRICALS IN A BARN&mdash;LAUNCH UPON LONDON&mdash;A
      CITY NIGHT SCENE&mdash;STRUGGLES WITH PENURY&mdash;MISERIES OF A TUTOR&mdash;A

      TRAGEDY IN EMBRYO&mdash;PROJECT OF THE WRITTEN MOUNTAINS
    </p>
    <p>
      After two years spent in roving about the Continent, &ldquo;pursuing
      novelty,&rdquo; as he said, &ldquo;and losing content,&rdquo; Goldsmith
      landed at Dover early in 1756. He appears to have had no definite plan of
      action. The death of his uncle Contarine, and the neglect of his relatives
      and friends to reply to his letters, seem to have produced in him a
      temporary feeling of loneliness and destitution, and his only thought was
      to get to London and throw himself upon the world. But how was he to get
      there? His purse was empty. England was to him as completely a foreign
      land as any part of the Continent, and where on earth is a penniless
      stranger more destitute? His flute and his philosophy were no longer of
      any avail; the English boors cared nothing for music; there were no
      convents; and as to the learned and the clergy, not one of them would give
      a vagrant scholar a supper and night&rsquo;s lodging for the best thesis
      that ever was argued. &ldquo;You may easily imagine,&rdquo; says he, in a
      subsequent letter to his brother-in-law, &ldquo;what difficulties I had to
      encounter, left as I was without friends, recommendations, money, or
      impudence, and that in a country where being born an Irishman was
      sufficient to keep me unemployed. Many, in such circumstances, would have
      had recourse to the friar&rsquo;s cord or the suicide&rsquo;s halter. But,
      with all my follies, I had principle to resist the one, and resolution to
      combat the other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He applied at one place, we are told, for employment in the shop of a
      country apothecary; but all his medical science gathered in foreign
      universities could not gain him the management of a pestle and mortar. He
      even resorted, it is said, to the stage as a temporary expedient, and
      figured in low comedy at a country town in Kent. This accords with his
      last shift of the &ldquo;Philosophic Vagabond,&rdquo; and with the
      knowledge of country theatricals displayed in his Adventures of a
      Strolling Player, or may be a story suggested by them. All this part of
      his career, however, in which he must have trod the lowest paths of
      humility, are only to be conjectured from vague traditions, or scraps of
      autobiography gleaned from his miscellaneous writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length we find him launched on the great metropolis, or rather drifting
      about its streets, at night, in the gloomy month of February, with but a
      few half-pence in his pocket. The deserts of Arabia are not more dreary
      and inhospitable than the streets of London at such a time, and to a
      stranger in such a plight. Do we want a picture as an illustration? We
      have it in his own words, and furnished, doubtless, from his own
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clock has just struck two; what a gloom hangs all around! no
      sound is heard but of the chiming clock, or the distant watch-dog. How few
      appear in those streets, which but some few hours ago were crowded! But
      who are those who make the streets their couch, and find a short repose
      from wretchedness at the doors of the opulent? They are strangers,
      wanderers, and orphans, whose circumstances are too humble to expect
      redress, and whose distresses are too great even for pity. Some are
      without the covering even of rags, and others emaciated with disease; the
      world has disclaimed them; society turns its back upon their distress, and
      has given them up to nakedness and hunger. <i>These poor shivering females
      have once seen happier days, and been flattered into beauty.</i> They are
      now turned out to meet the severity of winter. Perhaps now, lying at the
      doors of their betrayers, they sue to wretches whose hearts are
      insensible, or debauchees who may curse, but will not relieve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, why was I born a man, and yet see the sufferings of wretches I
      cannot relieve! Poor houseless creatures! The world will give you
      reproaches, but will not give you relief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor houseless Goldsmith! we may here ejaculate&mdash;to what shifts he
      must have been driven to find shelter and sustenance for himself in this
      his first venture into London! Many years afterward, in the days of his
      social elevation, he startled a polite circle at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;
      by humorously dating an anecdote about the time he &ldquo;lived among the
      beggars of Axe Lane.&rdquo; Such may have been the desolate quarters with
      which he was fain to content himself when thus adrift upon the town, with
      but a few half-pence in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first authentic trace we have of him in this new part of his career,
      is filling the situation of an usher to a school, and even this employ he
      obtained with some difficulty, after a reference for a character to his
      friends in the University of Dublin. In the Vicar of Wakefield he makes
      George Primrose undergo a whimsical catechism concerning the requisites
      for an usher. &ldquo;Have you been bred apprentice to the business?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t do for a school. Can you
      dress the boys&rsquo; hair?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t
      do for a school. Can you lie three in a bed?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Then you will never do for a school. Have you a good stomach?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then you will by no means do for a school. I
      have been an usher in a boarding-school myself, and may I die of an
      anodyne necklace, but I had rather be under-turnkey in Newgate. I was up
      early and late; I was browbeat by the master, hated for my ugly face by
      the mistress, worried by the boys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith remained but a short time in this situation, and to the
      mortifications experienced there we doubtless owe the picturings given in
      his writings of the hardships of an usher&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;He is
      generally,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the laughingstock of the school. Every
      trick is played upon him; the oddity of his manner, his dress, or his
      language, is a fund of eternal ridicule; the master himself now and then
      cannot avoid joining in the laugh; and the poor wretch, eternally
      resenting this ill-usage, lives in a state of war with all the family.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He
      is obliged, perhaps, to sleep in the same bed with the French teacher, who
      disturbs him for an hour every night in papering and filleting his hair,
      and stinks worse than a carrion with his rancid pomatums, when he lays his
      head beside him on the bolster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His next shift was as assistant in the laboratory of a chemist near Fish
      Street Hill. After remaining here a few months, he heard that Dr. Sleigh,
      who had been his friend and fellow-student at Edinburgh, was in London.
      Eager to meet with a friendly face in this land of strangers, he
      immediately called on him; &ldquo;but though it was Sunday, and it is to
      be supposed I was in my best clothes, Sleigh scarcely knew me&mdash;such
      is the tax the unfortunate pay to poverty. However, when he did recollect
      me, I found his heart as warm as ever, and he shared his purse and
      friendship with me during his continuance in London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the advice and assistance of Dr. Sleigh, he now commenced the
      practice of medicine, but in a small way, in Bankside, Southwark, and
      chiefly among the poor; for he wanted the figure, address, polish, and
      management, to succeed among the rich. His old schoolmate and college
      companion, Beatty, who used to aid him with his purse at the university,
      met him about this time, decked out in the tarnished finery of a
      second-hand suit of green and gold, with a shirt and neckcloth of a
      fortnight&rsquo;s wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Goldsmith endeavored to assume a prosperous air in the eyes of his
      early associate. &ldquo;He was practicing physic,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
      <i>doing very well!</i>&rdquo; At this moment poverty was pinching him to
      the bone in spite of his practice and his dirty finery. His fees were
      necessarily small, and ill paid, and he was fain to seek some precarious
      assistance from his pen. Here his quondam fellow-student, Dr. Sleigh, was
      again of service, introducing him to some of the booksellers, who gave him
      occasional, though starveling employment. According to tradition, however,
      his most efficient patron just now was a journeyman printer, one of his
      poor patients of Bankside, who had formed a good opinion of his talents,
      and perceived his poverty and his literary shifts. The printer was in the
      employ of Mr. Samuel Richardson, the author of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir
      Charles Grandison; who combined the novelist and the publisher, and was in
      flourishing circumstances. Through the journeyman&rsquo;s intervention
      Goldsmith is said to have become acquainted with Richardson, who employed
      him as reader and corrector of the press, at his printing establishment in
      Salisbury Court; an occupation which he alternated with his medical
      duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being admitted occasionally to Richardson&rsquo;s parlor, he began to form
      literary acquaintances, among whom the most important was Dr. Young, the
      author of Night Thoughts, a poem in the height of fashion. It is not
      probable, however, that much familiarity took place at the time between
      the literary lion of the day and the poor Aesculapius of Bankside, the
      humble corrector of the press. Still the communion with literary men had
      its effect to set his imagination teeming. Dr. Farr, one of his Edinburgh
      fellow-students, who was at London about this time, attending the
      hospitals and lectures, gives us an amusing account of Goldsmith in his
      literary character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early in January he called upon me one morning before I was up,
      and, on my entering the room, I recognized my old acquaintance, dressed in
      a rusty, full-trimmed black suit, with his pockets full of papers, which
      instantly reminded me of the poet in Garrick&rsquo;s farce of Lethe. After
      we had finished our breakfast he drew from his pocket part of a tragedy,
      which he said he had brought for my correction. In vain I pleaded
      inability, when he began to read; and every part on which I expressed a
      doubt as to the propriety was immediately blotted out. I then most
      earnestly pressed him not to trust to my judgment, but to take the opinion
      of persons better qualified to decide on dramatic compositions. He now
      told me he had submitted his productions, so far as he had written, to Mr.
      Richardson, the author of Clarissa, on which I peremptorily declined
      offering another criticism on the performance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the graphic description given of him by Dr. Farr, it will be
      perceived that the tarnished finery of green and gold had been succeeded
      by a professional suit of black, to which, we are told, were added the wig
      and cane indispensable to medical doctors in those days. The coat was a
      second-hand one, of rusty velvet, with a patch on the left breast, which
      he adroitly covered with his three-cornered hat during his medical visits;
      and we have an amusing anecdote of his contest of courtesy with a patient
      who persisted in endeavoring to relieve him from the hat, which only made
      him press it more devoutly to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing further has ever been heard of the tragedy mentioned by Dr. Farr;
      it was probably never completed. The same gentleman speaks of a strange
      Quixotic scheme which Goldsmith had in contemplation at the time, &ldquo;of
      going to decipher the inscriptions on the <i>written mountains</i>,&rdquo;
      though he was altogether ignorant of Arabic, or the language in which they
      might be supposed to be written. &ldquo;The salary of three hundred
      pounds,&rdquo; adds Dr. Farr, &ldquo;which had been left for the purpose,
      was the temptation.&rdquo; This was probably one of many dreamy projects
      with which his fervid brain was apt to teem. On such subjects he was prone
      to talk vaguely and magnificently, but inconsiderately, from a kindled
      imagination rather than a well-instructed judgment. He had always a great
      notion of expeditions to the East, and wonders to be seen and effected in
      the Oriental countries.

      LIFE OP A PEDAGOGUE&mdash;KINDNESS TO SCHOOLBOYS&mdash;PERTNESS IN RETURN&mdash;EXPENSIVE
      CHARITIES&mdash;THE GRIFFITHS AND THE &ldquo;MONTHLY REVIEW&rdquo;&mdash;TOILS
      OF A LITERARY HACK&mdash;RUPTURE WITH THE GRIFFITHS
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the most cordial of Goldsmith&rsquo;s intimates in London during
      this time of precarious struggle were certain of his former
      fellow-students in Edinburgh. One of these was the son of a Dr. Milner, a
      dissenting minister, who kept a classical school of eminence at Peckham,
      in Surrey. Young Milner had a favorable opinion of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      abilities and attainments, and cherished for him that good will which his
      genial nature seems ever to have inspired among his school and college
      associates. His father falling ill, the young man negotiated with
      Goldsmith to take temporary charge of the school. The latter readily
      consented; for he was discouraged by the slow growth of medical reputation
      and practice, and as yet had no confidence in the coy smiles of the muse.
      Laying by his wig and cane, therefore, and once more wielding the ferule,
      he resumed the character of the pedagogue, and for some time reigned as
      vicegerent over the academy at Peckham. He appears to have been well
      treated by both Dr. Milner and his wife, and became a favorite with the
      scholars from his easy, indulgent good nature. He mingled in their sports,
      told them droll stories, played on the flute for their amusement, and
      spent his money in treating them to sweetmeats and other schoolboy
      dainties. His familiarity was sometimes carried too far; he indulged in
      boyish pranks and practical jokes, and drew upon himself retorts in kind,
      which, however, he bore with great good humor. Once, indeed, he was
      touched to the quick by a piece of schoolboy pertness. After playing on
      the flute, he spoke with enthusiasm of music, as delightful in itself, and
      as a valuable accomplishment for a gentleman, whereupon a youngster, with
      a glance at his ungainly person, wished to know if he considered himself a
      gentleman. Poor Goldsmith, feelingly alive to the awkwardness of his
      appearance and the humility of his situation, winced at this unthinking
      sneer, which long rankled in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, while in Dr. Milner&rsquo;s employ, his benevolent feelings were
      a heavy tax upon his purse, for he never could resist a tale of distress,
      and was apt to be fleeced by every sturdy beggar; so that, between his
      charity and his munificence, he was generally in advance of his slender
      salary. &ldquo;You had better, Mr. Goldsmith, let me take care of your
      money,&rdquo; said Mrs. Milner one day, &ldquo;as I do for some of the
      young gentlemen.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In truth, madam, there is equal need!&rdquo;
      was the good-humored reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Milner was a man of some literary pretensions, and wrote occasionally
      for the &ldquo;Monthly Review,&rdquo; of which a bookseller, by the name
      of Griffiths, was proprietor. This work was an advocate for Whig
      principles, and had been in prosperous existence for nearly eight years.
      Of late, however, periodicals had multiplied exceedingly, and a formidable
      Tory rival had started up in the &ldquo;Critical Review,&rdquo; published
      by Archibald Hamilton, a bookseller, and aided by the powerful and popular
      pen of Dr. Smollett. Griffiths was obliged to recruit his forces. While so
      doing he met Goldsmith, a humble occupant of a seat at Dr. Milner&rsquo;s
      table, and was struck with remarks on men and books which fell from him in
      the course of conversation. He took occasion to sound him privately as to
      his inclination and capacity as a reviewer, and was furnished by him with
      specimens of his literary and critical talents. They proved satisfactory.
      The consequence was that Goldsmith once more changed his mode of life, and
      in April, 1757, became a contributor to the &ldquo;Monthly Review,&rdquo;
      at a small fixed salary, with board and lodging, and accordingly took up
      his abode with Mr. Griffiths, at the sign of the Dunciad, Paternoster Row.
      As usual we trace this phase of his fortunes in his semi-fictitious
      writings; his sudden transmutation of the pedagogue into the author being
      humorously set forth in the case of &ldquo;George Primrose,&rdquo; in the
      Vicar of &ldquo;Wakefield.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; says George&rsquo;s
      adviser, &ldquo;I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning; what do
      you think of commencing author like me? You have read in books, no doubt,
      of men of genius starving at the trade; at present I&rsquo;ll show you
      forty very dull fellows about town that live by it in opulence. All
      honest, jog-trot men, who go on smoothly and dully, and write history and
      politics, and are praised: men, sir, who, had they been bred cobblers,
      would all their lives only have mended shoes, but never made them.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Finding&rdquo; (says George) &ldquo;that there is no great degree
      of gentility affixed to the character of an usher, I resolved to accept
      his proposal; and having the highest respect for literature, hailed the <i>antiqua
      mater</i> of Grub Street with reverence. I thought it my glory to pursue a
      track which Dryden and Otway trod before me. Alas, Dryden struggled with
      indigence all his days; and Otway, it is said, fell a victim to famine in
      his thirty-fifth year, being strangled by a roll of bread, which he
      devoured with the voracity of a starving man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In Goldsmith&rsquo;s experience the track soon proved a thorny one.
      Griffiths was a hard business man, of shrewd, worldly good sense, but
      little refinement or cultivation. He meddled, or rather muddled with
      literature, too, in a business way, altering and modifying occasionally
      the writings of his contributors, and in this he was aided by his wife,
      who, according to Smollett, was &ldquo;an antiquated female critic and a
      dabbler in the &lsquo;Review.&rsquo;&rdquo; Such was the literary
      vassalage to which Goldsmith had unwarily subjected himself. A diurnal
      drudgery was imposed on him, irksome to his indolent habits, and attended
      by circumstances humiliating to his pride. He had to write daily from nine
      o&rsquo;clock until two, and often throughout the day; whether in the vein
      or not, and on subjects dictated by his taskmaster, however foreign to his
      taste; in a word, he was treated as a mere literary hack. But this was not
      the worst; it was the critical supervision of Griffiths and his wife which
      grieved him: the &ldquo;illiterate, bookselling Griffiths,&rdquo; as
      Smollett called them, &ldquo;who presumed to revise, alter, and amend the
      articles contributed to their &lsquo;Review.&rsquo; Thank heaven,&rdquo;
      crowed Smollett, &ldquo;the &lsquo;Critical Review&rsquo; is not written
      under the restraint of a bookseller and his wife. Its principal writers
      are independent of each other, unconnected with booksellers, and unawed by
      old women!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This literary vassalage, however, did not last long. The bookseller became
      more and more exacting. He accused his hack writer of idleness; of
      abandoning his writing-desk and literary workshop at an early hour of the
      day; and of assuming a tone and manner <i>above his situation</i>.
      Goldsmith, in return, charged him with impertinence; his wife with
      meanness and parsimony in her household treatment of him, and both of
      literary meddling and marring. The engagement was broken off at the end of
      five months, by mutual consent, and without any violent rupture, as it
      will be found they afterward had occasional dealings with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Goldsmith was now nearly thirty years of age, he had produced
      nothing to give him a decided reputation. He was as yet a mere writer for
      bread. The articles he had contributed to the &ldquo;Review&rdquo; were
      anonymous, and were never avowed by him. They have since been, for the
      most part, ascertained; and though thrown off hastily, often treating on
      subjects of temporary interest, and marred by the Griffith interpolations,
      they are still characterized by his sound, easy, good sense, and the
      genial graces of his style. Johnson observed that Goldsmith&rsquo;s genius
      flowered late; he should have said it flowered early, but was late in
      bringing its fruit to maturity.

    <p>
      NEWBERY, OF PICTURE-BOOK MEMORY&mdash;HOW TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES&mdash;MISERIES
      OF AUTHORSHIP&mdash;A POOR RELATION&mdash;LETTER TO HODSON
    </p>
    <p>
      Being now known in the publishing world, Goldsmith began to find casual
      employment in various quarters; among others he wrote occasionally for the
      &ldquo;Literary Magazine,&rdquo; a production set on foot by Mr. John
      Newbery, bookseller, St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, renowned in nursery
      literature throughout the latter half of the last century for his
      picture-books for children. Newbery was a worthy, intelligent,
      kind-hearted man, and a seasonable though cautious friend to authors,
      relieving them with small loans when in pecuniary difficulties, though
      always taking care to be well repaid by the labor of their pens. Goldsmith
      introduces him in a humorous yet friendly manner in his novel of the Vicar
      of Wakefield. &ldquo;This person was no other than the philanthropic
      bookseller in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, who has written so many little
      books for children; he called himself their friend; but he was the friend
      of all mankind. He was no sooner alighted but he was in haste to be gone;
      for he was ever on business of importance, and was at that time actually
      compiling materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip. I immediately
      recollected this good-natured man&rsquo;s red-pimpled face.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides his literary job work, Goldsmith also resumed his medical
      practice, but with very trifling success. The scantiness of his purse
      still obliged him to live in obscure lodgings somewhere in the vicinity of
      Salisbury Square, Fleet Street; but his extended acquaintance and rising
      importance caused him to consult appearances. He adopted an expedient,
      then very common, and still practiced in London among those who have to
      tread the narrow path between pride and poverty; while he burrowed in
      lodgings suited to his means, he &ldquo;hailed,&rdquo; as it is termed,
      from the Temple Exchange Coffeehouse near Temple Bar. Here he received his
      medical calls; hence he dated his letters, and here he passed much of his
      leisure hours, conversing with the frequenters of the place. &ldquo;Thirty
      pounds a year,&rdquo; said a poor Irish painter, who understood the art of
      shifting, &ldquo;is enough to enable a man to live in London without being
      contemptible. Ten pounds will find him in clothes and linen; he can live
      in a garret on eighteen pence a week; hail from a coffee-house, where, by
      occasionally spending threepence, he may pass some hours each day in good
      company; he may breakfast on bread and milk for a penny; dine for
      sixpence; do without supper; and on <i>clean-shirt-day</i> he may go
      abroad and pay visits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith seems to have taken a leaf from this poor devil&rsquo;s manual
      in respect to the coffee-house at least. Indeed, coffee-houses in those
      days were the resorts of wits and literati, where the topics of the day
      were gossiped over, and the affairs of literature and the drama discussed
      and criticised. In this way he enlarged the circle of his intimacy, which
      now embraced several names of notoriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do we want a picture of Goldsmith&rsquo;s experience in this part of his
      career? we have it in his observations on the life of an author in the
      &ldquo;Inquiry into the State of Polite Learning,&rdquo; published some
      years afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The author, unpatronized by the great, has naturally recourse to
      the bookseller. There cannot, perhaps, be imagined a combination more
      prejudicial to taste than this. It is the interest of the one to allow as
      little for writing, and for the other to write as much as possible;
      accordingly tedious compilations and periodical magazines are the result
      of their joint endeavors. In these circumstances the author bids adieu to
      fame; writes for bread; and for that only imagination is seldom called in.
      He sits down to address the venal muse with the most phlegmatic apathy;
      and, as we are told of the Russian, courts his mistress by falling asleep
      in her lap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again. &ldquo;Those who are unacquainted with the world are apt to fancy
      the man of wit as leading a very agreeable life. They conclude, perhaps,
      that he is attended with silent admiration, and dictates to the rest of
      mankind with all the eloquence of conscious superiority. Very different is
      his present situation. He is called an author, and all know that an author
      is a thing only to be laughed at. His person, not his jest, becomes the
      mirth of the company. At his approach the most fat, unthinking face
      brightens into malicious meaning. Even aldermen laugh, and avenge on him
      the ridicule which was lavished on their forefathers.... The poet&rsquo;s
      poverty is a standing topic of contempt. His writing for bread is an
      unpardonable offense. Perhaps of all mankind an author in these times is
      used most hardly. We keep him poor, and yet revile his poverty. We
      reproach him for living by his wit, and yet allow him no other means to
      live. His taking refuge in garrets and cellars has of late been violently
      objected to him, and that by men who, I hope, are more apt to pity than
      insult his distress. Is poverty a careless fault? No doubt he knows how to
      prefer a bottle of champagne to the nectar of the neighboring ale-house,
      or a venison pasty to a plate of potatoes. Want of delicacy is not in him,
      but in those who deny him the opportunity of making an elegant choice. Wit
      certainly is the property of those who have it, nor should we be
      displeased if it is the only property a man sometimes has. We must not
      underrate him who uses it for subsistence, and flees from the ingratitude
      of the age even to a bookseller for redress.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the author be necessary among us, let us treat him with proper
      consideration as a child of the public, not as a rent-charge on the
      community. And indeed a child of the public he is in all respects; for
      while so well able to direct others, how incapable is he frequently found
      of guiding himself. His simplicity exposes him to all the insidious
      approaches of cunning; his sensibility, to the slightest invasions of
      contempt. Though possessed of fortitude to stand unmoved the expected
      bursts of an earthquake, yet of feelings so exquisitely poignant as to
      agonize under the slightest disappointment. Broken rest, tasteless meals,
      and causeless anxieties shorten life, and render it unfit for active
      employments; prolonged vigils and intense application still further
      contract his span, and make his time glide insensibly away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While poor Goldsmith was thus struggling with the difficulties and
      discouragements which in those days beset the path of an author, his
      friends in Ireland received accounts of his literary success and of the
      distinguished acquaintances he was making. This was enough to put the wise
      heads at Lissoy and Ballymahon in a ferment of conjectures. With the
      exaggerated notions of provincial relatives concerning the family great
      man in the metropolis, some of Goldsmith&rsquo;s poor kindred pictured him
      to themselves seated in high places, clothed in purple and fine linen, and
      hand and glove with the givers of gifts and dispensers of patronage.
      Accordingly, he was one day surprised at the sudden apparition, in his
      miserable lodging, of his younger brother Charles, a raw youth of
      twenty-one, endowed with a double share of the family heedlessness, and
      who expected to be forthwith helped into some snug by-path to fortune by
      one or other of Oliver&rsquo;s great friends. Charles was sadly
      disconcerted on learning that, so far from being able to provide for
      others, his brother could scarcely take care of himself. He looked round
      with a rueful eye on the poet&rsquo;s quarters, and could not help
      expressing his surprise and disappointment at finding him no better off.
      &ldquo;All in good tune, my dear boy,&rdquo; replied poor Goldsmith, with
      infinite good-humor; &ldquo;I shall be richer by-and-by. Addison, let me
      tell you, wrote his poem of the Campaign in a garret in the Haymarket,
      three stones high, and you see I am not come to that yet, for I have only
      got to the second story.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Goldsmith did not remain long to embarrass his brother in London.
      With the same roving disposition and inconsiderate temper of Oliver, he
      suddenly departed in a humble capacity to seek his fortune in the West
      Indies, and nothing was heard of him for above thirty years, when, after
      having been given up as dead by his friends, he made his reappearance in
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after his departure Goldsmith wrote a letter to his
      brother-in-law, Daniel Hodson, Esq., of which the following is an extract;
      it was partly intended, no doubt, to dissipate any further illusions
      concerning his fortunes which might float on the magnificent imagination
      of his friends in Ballymahon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you desire to know my present situation. As there is
      nothing in it at which I should blush, or which mankind could censure, I
      see no reason for making it a secret. In short, by a very little practice
      as a physician, and a very little reputation as a poet, I make a shift to
      live. Nothing is more apt to introduce us to the gates of the muses than
      poverty; but it were well if they only left us at the door. The mischief
      is they sometimes choose to give us their company to the entertainment;
      and want, instead of being gentleman-usher, often turns master of the
      ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, upon learning I write, no doubt you imagine I starve; and the
      name of an author naturally reminds you of a garret. In this particular I
      do not think proper to undeceive my friends. But, whether I eat or starve,
      live in a first floor or four pairs of stairs high, I still remember them
      with ardor; nay, my very country comes in for a share of my affection.
      Unaccountable fondness for country, this <i>maladie du pais</i>, as the
      French call it! Unaccountable that he should still have an affection for a
      place, who never, when in it, received above common civility; who never
      brought anything out of it except his brogue and his blunders. Surely my
      affection is equally ridiculous with the Scotchman&rsquo;s, who refused to
      be cured of the itch because it made him unco&rsquo; thoughtful of his
      wife and bonny Inverary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now, to be serious: let me ask myself what gives me a wish to
      see Ireland again. The country is a fine one, perhaps? No. There are good
      company in Ireland? No. The conversation there is generally made up of a
      smutty toast or a bawdy song; the vivacity supported by some humble
      cousin, who had just folly enough to earn his dinner. Then, perhaps, there&rsquo;s
      more wit and learning among the Irish? Oh, Lord, no! There has been more
      money spent in the encouragement of the Padareen mare there one season
      than given in rewards to learned men since the time of Usher. All their
      productions in learning amount to perhaps a translation, or a few tracts
      in divinity; and all their productions in wit to just nothing at all. Why
      the plague, then, so fond of Ireland? Then, all at once, because you, my
      dear friend, and a few more who are exceptions to the general picture,
      have a residence there. This it is that gives me all the pangs I feel in
      separation. I confess I carry this spirit sometimes to the souring the
      pleasures I at present possess. If I go to the opera, where Signora
      Columba pours out all the mazes of melody, I sit and sigh for Lissoy
      fireside, and Johnny Armstrong&rsquo;s &lsquo;Last Good-night&rsquo; from
      Peggy Golden. If I climb Hampstead Hill, than where nature never exhibited
      a more magnificent prospect, I confess it fine; but then I had rather be
      placed on the little mount before Lissoy gate, and there take in, to me,
      the most pleasing horizon in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before Charles came hither my thoughts sometimes found refuge from
      severer studies among my friends in Ireland. I fancied strange revolutions
      at home; but I find it was the rapidity of my own motion that gave an
      imaginary one to objects really at rest. No alterations there. Some
      friends, he tells me, are still lean, but very rich; others very fat, but
      still very poor. Nay, all the news I hear of you is, that you sally out in
      visits among the neighbors, and sometimes make a migration from the blue
      bed to the brown. I could from my heart wish that you and she (Mrs.
      Hodson), and Lissoy and Ballymahon, and all of you, would fairly make a
      migration into Middlesex; though, upon second thoughts, this might be
      attended with a few inconveniences. Therefore, as the mountain will not
      come to Mohammed, why Mohammed shall go to the mountain; or, to speak
      plain English, as you cannot conveniently pay me a visit, if next summer I
      can contrive to be absent six weeks from London, I shall spend three of
      them among my friends in Ireland. But first, believe me, my design is
      purely to visit, and neither to cut a figure nor levy contributions;
      neither to excite envy nor solicit favor; in fact, my circumstances are
      adapted to neither. I am too poor to be gazed at, and too rich to need
      assistance.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      For some time Goldsmith continued to write miscellaneously for reviews and
      other periodical publications, but without making any decided hit, to use
      a technical term. Indeed, as yet he appeared destitute of the strong
      excitement of literary ambition, and wrote only on the spur of necessity
      and at the urgent importunity of his bookseller. His indolent and truant
      disposition, ever averse from labor and delighting in holiday, had to be
      scourged up to its task; still it was this very truant disposition which
      threw an unconscious charm over everything he wrote; bringing with it
      honeyed thoughts and pictured images which had sprung up in his mind in
      the sunny hours of idleness: these effusions, dashed off on compulsion in
      the exigency of the moment, were published anonymously; so that they made
      no collective impression on the public, and reflected no fame on the name
      of their author.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an essay published some time subsequently in the &ldquo;Bee,&rdquo;
      Goldsmith adverts, in his own humorous way, to his impatience at the
      tardiness with which his desultory and unacknowledged essays crept into
      notice. &ldquo;I was once induced,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to show my
      indignation against the public by discontinuing my efforts to please; and
      was bravely resolved, like Raleigh, to vex them by burning my manuscripts
      in a passion. Upon reflection, however, I considered what set or body of
      people would be displeased at my rashness. The sun, after so sad an
      accident, might shine next morning as bright as usual; men might laugh and
      sing the next day, and transact business as before; and not a single
      creature feel any regret but myself. Instead of having Apollo in mourning
      or the Muses in a fit of the spleen; instead of having the learned world
      apostrophizing at my untimely decease; perhaps all Grub Street might laugh
      at my fate, and self-approving dignity be unable to shield me from
      ridicule.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Circumstances occurred about this time to give a new direction to
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s hopes and schemes. Having resumed for a brief period the
      superintendence of the Peckham school during a fit of illness of Dr.
      Milner, that gentleman, in requital for his timely services, promised to
      use his influence with a friend, an East India director, to procure him a
      medical appointment in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was every reason to believe that the influence of Dr. Milner would
      be effectual; but how was Goldsmith to find the ways and means of fitting
      himself out for a voyage to the Indies? In this emergency he was driven to
      a more extended exercise of the pen than he had yet attempted. His
      skirmishing among books as a reviewer, and his disputatious ramble among
      the schools and universities and literati of the Continent, had filled his
      mind with facts and observations which he now set about digesting into a
      treatise of some magnitude, to be entitled &ldquo;An Inquiry into the
      Present State of Polite Learning in Europe.&rdquo; As the work grew on his
      hands his sanguine temper ran ahead of his labors. Feeling secure of
      success in England, he was anxious to forestall the piracy of the Irish
      press; for as yet, the Union not having taken place, the English law of
      copyright did not extend to the other side of the Irish Channel. He wrote,
      therefore, to his friends in Ireland, urging them to circulate his
      proposals for his contemplated work, and obtain subscriptions payable in
      advance; the money to be transmitted to a Mr. Bradley, an eminent
      bookseller in Dublin, who would give a receipt for it and be accountable
      for the delivery of the books. The letters written by him on this occasion
      are worthy of copious citation as being full of character and interest.
      One was to his relative and college intimate, Edward Wells, who had
      studied for the bar, but was now living at ease on his estate at
      Roscommon. &ldquo;You have quitted,&rdquo; writes Goldsmith, &ldquo;the
      plan of life which you once intended to pursue, and given up ambition for
      domestic tranquillity. I cannot avoid feeling some regret that one of my
      few friends has declined a pursuit in which he had every reason to expect
      success. I have often let my fancy loose when you were the subject, and
      have imagined you gracing the bench, or thundering at the bar: while I
      have taken no small pride to myself, and whispered to all that I could
      come near, that this was my cousin. Instead of this, it seems, you are
      merely contented to be a happy man; to be esteemed by your acquaintances;
      to cultivate your paternal acres; to take unmolested a nap under one of
      your own hawthorns or in Mrs. Wells&rsquo; bedchamber, which, even a poet
      must confess, is rather the more comfortable place of the two. But,
      however your resolutions may be altered with regard to your situation in
      life, I persuade myself they are unalterable with respect to your friends
      in it. I cannot think the world has taken such entire possession of that
      heart (once so susceptible of friendship) as not to have left a corner
      there for a friend or two, but I flatter myself that even I have a place
      among the number. This I have a claim to from the similitude of our
      dispositions; or setting that aside, I can demand it as a right by the
      most equitable law of nature; I mean that of retaliation; for indeed you
      have more than your share in mine. I am a man of few professions; and yet
      at this very instant I cannot avoid the painful apprehension that my
      present professions (which speak not half my feelings) should be
      considered only as a pretext to cover a request, as I have a request to
      make. No, my dear Ned, I know you are too generous to think so, and you
      know me too proud to stoop to unnecessary insincerity&mdash;I have a
      request, it is true, to make; but as I know to whom I am a petitioner, I
      make it without diffidence or confusion. It is in short, this, I am going
      to publish a book in London,&rdquo; etc. The residue of the letter
      specifies the nature of the request, which was merely to aid in
      circulating his proposals and obtaining subscriptions. The letter of the
      poor author, however, was unattended to and unacknowledged by the
      prosperous Mr. Wells, of Roscommon, though in after years he was proud to
      claim relationship to Dr. Goldsmith, when he had risen to celebrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of Goldsmith&rsquo;s letters was to Robert Bryanton, with whom he
      had long ceased to be in correspondence. &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; writes
      he, &ldquo;that they who are drunk, or out of their wits, fancy everybody
      else in the same condition. Mine is a friendship that neither distance nor
      tune can efface, which is probably the reason that, for the soul of me, I
      can&rsquo;t avoid thinking yours of the same complexion; and yet I have
      many reasons for being of a contrary opinion, else why, in so long an
      absence, was I never made a partner in your concerns? To hear of your
      success would have given me the utmost pleasure; and a communication of
      your very disappointments would divide the uneasiness I too frequently
      feel for my own. Indeed, my dear Bob, you don&rsquo;t conceive how
      unkindly you have treated one whose circumstances afford him few prospects
      of pleasure, except those reflected from the happiness of his friends.
      However, since you have not let me hear from you, I have in some measure
      disappointed your neglect by frequently thinking of you. Every day or so I
      remember the calm anecdotes of your life, from the fireside to the
      easy-chair; recall the various adventures that first cemented our
      friendship; the school, the college, or the tavern; preside in fancy over
      your cards; and am displeased at your bad play when the rubber goes
      against you, though not with all that agony of soul as when I was once
      your partner. Is it not strange that two of such like affections should be
      so much separated, and so differently employed as we are? You seem placed
      at the center of fortune&rsquo;s wheel, and, let it revolve ever so fast,
      are insensible of the motion. I seem to have been tied to the
      circumference, and whirled disagreeably round, as if on a whirligig.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then runs into a whimsical and extravagant tirade about his future
      prospects. The wonderful career of fame and fortune that awaits him, and
      after indulging in all kinds of humorous gasconades, concludes: &ldquo;Let
      me, then, stop my fancy to take a view of my future self&mdash;and, as the
      boys say, light down to see myself on horseback. Well, now that I am down,
      where the d&mdash;l <i>is I</i>? Oh gods! gods! here in a garret, writing
      for bread, and expecting to be dunned for a milk score!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He would, on this occasion, have doubtless written to his uncle Contarine,
      but that generous friend was sunk into a helpless, hopeless state from
      which death soon released him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cut off thus from the kind co-operation of his uncle, he addresses a
      letter to his daughter Jane, the companion of his schoolboy and happy
      days, now the wife of Mr. Lawder. The object was to secure her interest
      with her husband in promoting the circulation of his proposals. The letter
      is full of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should ask,&rdquo; he begins, &ldquo;why, in an interval of
      so many years, you never heard from me, permit me, madam, to ask the same
      question. I have the best excuse in recrimination. I wrote to Kilmore from
      Leyden in Holland, from Louvain in Flanders, and Rouen in France, but
      received no answer. To what could I attribute this silence but to
      displeasure or forgetfulness? Whether I was right in my conjecture I do
      not pretend to determine; but this I must ingenuously own that I have a
      thousand times in my turn endeavored to forget <i>them</i>, whom I could
      not but look upon as forgetting <i>me</i>. I have attempted to blot their
      names from my memory, and, I confess it, spent whole days in efforts to
      tear their image from my heart. Could I have succeeded, you had not now
      been troubled with this renewal of a discontinued correspondence; but, as
      every effort the restless make to procure sleep serves but to keep them
      waking, all my attempts contributed to impress what I would forget deeper
      on my imagination. But this subject I would willingly turn from, and yet,
      &lsquo;for the soul of me,&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t till I have said all. I
      was, madam, when I discontinued writing to Kilmore, in such circumstances
      that all my endeavors to continue your regards might be attributed to
      wrong motives. My letters might be looked upon as the petitions of a
      beggar, and not the offerings of a friend; while all my professions,
      instead of being considered as the result of disinterested esteem, might
      be ascribed to venal insincerity. I believe, indeed, you had too much
      generosity to place them in such a light, but I could not bear even the
      shadow of such a suspicion. The most delicate friendships are always most
      sensible of the slightest invasion, and the strongest jealousy is ever
      attendant on the warmest regard. I could not&mdash;I own I could not&mdash;continue
      a correspondence in which every acknowledgment for past favors might be
      considered as an indirect request for future ones; and where it might be
      thought I gave my heart from a motive of gratitude alone, when I was
      conscious of having bestowed it on much more disinterested principles. It
      is true, this conduct might have been simple enough; but yourself must
      confess it was in character. Those who know me at all, know that I have
      always been actuated by different principles from the rest of mankind: and
      while none regarded the interest of his friend more, no man on earth
      regarded his own less. I have often affected bluntness to avoid the
      imputation of flattery; have frequently seemed to overlook those merits
      too obvious to escape notice, and pretended disregard to those instances
      of good nature and good sense, which I could not fail tacitly to applaud;
      and all this lest I should be ranked among the grinning tribe, who say
      &lsquo;very true&rsquo; to all that is said; who fill a vacant chair at a
      tea-table; whose narrow souls never moved in a wider circle than the
      circumference of a guinea; and who had rather be reckoning the money in
      your pocket than the virtue in your breast. All this, I say, I have done,
      and a thousand other very silly, though very disinterested, things in my
      time, and for all which no soul cares a farthing about me.... Is it to be
      wondered that he should once in his life forget you, who has been all his
      life forgetting himself? However, it is probable you may one of these days
      see me turned into a perfect hunks, and as dark and intricate as a
      mouse-hole. I have already given my landlady orders for an entire reform
      in the state of my finances. I declaim against hot suppers, drink less
      sugar in my tea, and check my grate with brickbats. Instead of hanging my
      room with pictures, I intend to adorn it with maxims of frugality. Those
      will make pretty furniture enough, and won&rsquo;t be a bit too expensive;
      for I will draw them all out with my own hands, and my landlady&rsquo;s
      daughter shall frame them with the parings of my black waistcoat. Each
      maxim is to be inscribed on a sheet of clean paper, and wrote with my best
      pen; of which the following will serve as a specimen. <i>Look sharp: Mind
      the main chance: Money is money now: If you have a thousand pounds you can
      put your hands by your sides, and say you are worth a thousand pounds
      every day of the year: Take a farthing from a hundred and it will be a
      hundred no longer.</i> Thus, which way soever I turn my eyes, they are
      sure to meet one of those friendly monitors; and as we are told of an
      actor who hung his room round with looking-glass to correct the defects of
      his person, my apartment shall be furnished in a peculiar manner, to
      correct the errors of my mind. Faith! madam, I heartily wish to be rich,
      if it were only for this reason, to say without a blush how much I esteem
      you. But, alas! I have many a fatigue to encounter before that happy times
      comes, when your poor old simple friend may again give a loose to the
      luxuriance of his nature; sitting by Kilmore fireside, recount the various
      adventures of a hard-fought life; laugh over the follies of the day; join
      his flute to your harpsichord; and forget that ever he starved in those
      streets where Butler and Otway starved before him. And now I mention those
      great names&mdash;my uncle! he is no more that soul of fire as when I once
      knew him. Newton and Swift grew dim with age as well as he. But what shall
      I say? His mind was too active an inhabitant not to disorder the feeble
      mansion of its abode: for the richest jewels soonest wear their settings.
      Yet who but the fool would lament his condition! He now forgets the
      calamities of life. Perhaps indulgent Heaven has given him a foretaste of
      that tranquillity here, which he so well deserves hereafter. But I must
      come to business; for business, as one of my maxims tells me, must be
      minded or lost. I am going to publish in London a book entitled &lsquo;The
      Present State of Taste and Literature in Europe.&rsquo; The booksellers in
      Ireland republish every performance there without making the author any
      consideration. I would, in this respect, disappoint their avarice and have
      all the profits of my labor to myself. I must therefore request Mr. Lawder
      to circulate among his friends and acquaintances a hundred of my proposals
      which I have given the bookseller, Mr. Bradley, in Dame Street, directions
      to send to him. If, in pursuance of such circulation, he should receive
      any subscriptions, I entreat, when collected, they may be sent to Mr.
      Bradley, as aforesaid, who will give a receipt, and be accountable for the
      work, or a return of the subscription. If this request (which, if it be
      complied with, will in some measure be an encouragement to a man of
      learning) should be disagreeable or troublesome, I would not press it; for
      I would be the last man on earth to have my labors go a-begging; but if I
      know Mr. Lawder (and sure I ought to know him), he will accept the
      employment with pleasure. All I can say&mdash;if he writes a book, I will
      get him two hundred subscribers, and those of the best wits in Europe.
      Whether this request is complied with or not, I shall not be uneasy; but
      there is one petition I must make to him and to you, which I solicit with
      the warmest ardor, and in which I cannot bear a refusal. I mean, dear
      madam, that I may be allowed to subscribe myself, your ever affectionate
      and obliged kinsman, OLIVER GOLDSMITH. Now see how I blot and blunder,
      when I am asking a favor.&rdquo;

      HEROIC POETRY
    </p>
    <p>
      While Goldsmith was yet laboring at his treatise, the promise made him by
      Dr. Milner was carried into effect, and he was actually appointed
      physician and surgeon to one of the factories on the coast of Coromandel.
      His imagination was immediately on fire with visions of Oriental wealth
      and magnificence. It is true the salary did not exceed one hundred pounds,
      but then, as appointed physician, he would have the exclusive practice of
      the place, amounting to one thousand pounds per annum; with advantages to
      be derived from trade, and from the high interest of money&mdash;twenty
      per cent; in a word, for once in his life, the road to fortune lay broad
      and straight before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, in his correspondence with his friends, he had said nothing of
      his India scheme; but now he imparted to them his brilliant prospects,
      urging the importance of their circulating his proposals and obtaining him
      subscriptions and advances on his forthcoming work, to furnish funds for
      his outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime he had to task that poor drudge, his muse, for present
      exigencies. Ten pounds were demanded for his appointment-warrant. Other
      expenses pressed hard upon him. Fortunately, though as yet unknown to
      fame, his literary capability was known to &ldquo;the trade,&rdquo; and
      the coinage of his brain passed current in Grub Street. Archibald
      Hamilton, proprietor of the &ldquo;Critical Review,&rdquo; the rival to
      that of Griffiths, readily made him a small advance on receiving three
      articles for his periodical. His purse thus slenderly replenished,
      Goldsmith paid for his warrant; wiped off the score of his milkmaid;
      abandoned his garret, and moved into a shabby first floor in a forlorn
      court near the Old Bailey; there to await the time for his migration to
      the magnificent coast of Coromandel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! poor Goldsmith! ever doomed to disappointment. Early in the gloomy
      month of November, that mouth of fog and despondency in London, he learned
      the shipwreck of his hope. The great Coromandel enterprise fell through;
      or rather the post promised to him was transferred to some other
      candidate. The cause of this disappointment it is now impossible to
      ascertain. The death of his quasi patron, Dr. Milner, which happened about
      this time, may have had some effect in producing it; or there may have
      been some heedlessness and blundering on his own part; or some obstacle
      arising from his insuperable indigence; whatever may have been the cause,
      he never mentioned it, which gives some ground to surmise that he himself
      was to blame. His friends learned with surprise that he had suddenly
      relinquished his appointment to India, about which he had raised such
      sanguine expectations: some accused him of fickleness and caprice; others
      supposed him unwilling to tear himself from the growing fascinations of
      the literary society of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, cut down in his hopes and humiliated in his pride by the
      failure of his Coromandel scheme, he sought, without consulting his
      friends, to be examined at the College of Physicians for the humble
      situation of hospital mate. Even here poverty stood in his way. It was
      necessary to appear in a decent garb before the examining committee; but
      how was he to do so? He was literally out at elbows as well as out of
      cash. Here again the muse, so often jilted and neglected by him, came to
      his aid. In consideration of four articles furnished to the &ldquo;Monthly
      Review,&rdquo; Griffiths, his old taskmaster, was to become his security
      to the tailor for a suit of clothes. Goldsmith said he wanted them but for
      a single occasion, on which depended his appointment to a situation in the
      army; as soon as that temporary purpose was served they would either be
      returned or paid for. The books to be reviewed were accordingly lent to
      him; the muse was again set to her compulsory drudgery; the articles were
      scribbled off and sent to the bookseller, and the clothes came in due time
      from the tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the records of the College of Surgeons, it appears that Goldsmith
      underwent his examination at Surgeons&rsquo; Hall, on the 21st of
      December, 1758.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either from a confusion of mind incident to sensitive and imaginative
      persons on such occasions, or from a real want of surgical science, which
      last is extremely probable, he failed in his examination, and was rejected
      as unqualified. The effect of such a rejection was to disqualify him for
      every branch of public service, though he might have claimed a
      re-examination, after the interval of a few months devoted to further
      study. Such a re-examination he never attempted, nor did he ever
      communicate his discomfiture to any of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Christmas day, but four days after his rejection by the College of
      Surgeons, while he was suffering under the mortification of defeat and
      disappointment, and hard pressed for means of subsistence, he was
      surprised by the entrance into his room of the poor woman of whom he hired
      his wretched apartment, and to whom he owed some small arrears of rent.
      She had a piteous tale of distress, and was clamorous in her afflictions.
      Her husband had been arrested in the night for debt, and thrown into
      prison. This was too much for the quick feelings of Goldsmith; he was
      ready at any time to help the distressed, but in this instance he was
      himself in some measure a cause of the distress. What was to be done? He
      had no money, it is true; but there hung the new suit of clothes in which
      he had stood his unlucky examination at Surgeons&rsquo; Hall. Without
      giving himself time for reflection, he sent it off to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s,
      and raised thereon a sufficient sum to pay off his own debt, and to
      release his landlord from prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the same pressure of penury and despondency, he borrowed from a
      neighbor a pittance to relieve his immediate wants, leaving as a security
      the books which he had recently reviewed. In the midst of these straits
      and harassments, he received a letter from Griffiths, demanding in
      peremptory terms the return of the clothes and books, or immediate payment
      for the same. It appears that he had discovered the identical suit at the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s. The reply of Goldsmith is not known; it was out of his
      power to furnish either the clothes or the money; but he probably offered
      once more to make the muse stand his bail. His reply only increased the
      ire of the wealthy man of trade, and drew from him another letter still
      more harsh than the first, using the epithets of knave and sharper, and
      containing threats of prosecution and a prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter from poor Goldsmith gives the most touching picture
      of an inconsiderate but sensitive man, harassed by care, stung by
      humiliations, and driven almost to despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;I know of no misery but a jail to which my own
      imprudences and your letter seem to point. I have seen it inevitable these
      three or four weeks, and, by heavens! request it as a favor&mdash;as a
      favor that may prevent something more fatal. I have been some years
      struggling with a wretched being&mdash;with all that contempt that
      indigence brings with it&mdash;with all those passions which make contempt
      insupportable. What, then, has a jail that is formidable. I shall at least
      have the society of wretches, and such is to me true society. I tell you,
      again and again, that I am neither able nor willing to pay you a farthing,
      but I will be punctual to any appointment you or the tailor shall make:
      thus far, at least, I do not act the sharper, since, unable to pay my own
      debts one way, I would generally give some security another. No, sir; had
      I been a sharper&mdash;had I been possessed of less good-nature and native
      generosity, I might surely now have been in better circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am guilty, I own, of meannesses which poverty unavoidably brings
      with it: my reflections are filled with repentance for my imprudence, but
      not with any remorse for being a villain; that may be a character you
      unjustly charge me with. Your books, I can assure you, are neither pawned
      nor sold, but in the custody of a friend, from whom my necessities obliged
      me to borrow some money: whatever becomes of my person, you shall have
      them in a month. It is very possible both the reports you have heard and
      your own suggestions may have brought you false information with, respect
      to my character; it is very possible that the man whom you now regard with
      detestation may inwardly burn with grateful resentment. It is very
      possible that, upon a second perusal of the letter I sent you, you may see
      the workings of a mind strongly agitated with gratitude and jealousy. If
      such circumstances should appear, at least spare invective till my book
      with Mr. Dodsley shall be published, and then, perhaps, you may see the
      bright side of a mind, when my professions shall not appear the dictates
      of necessity, but of choice.

      &ldquo;You seem to think Dr. Milner knew me not. Perhaps so; but he was a

      professions than that I am, sir, your humble servant,

      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I shall expect impatiently the result of your
      resolutions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispute between the poet and the publisher was afterward imperfectly
      adjusted, and it would appear that the clothes were paid for by a short
      compilation advertised by Griffiths in the course of the following month;
      but the parties were never really friends afterward, and the writings of
      Goldsmith were harshly and unjustly treated in the &ldquo;Monthly Review.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have given the preceding anecdote in detail, as furnishing one of the
      many instances in which Goldsmith&rsquo;s prompt and benevolent impulses
      outran all prudent forecast, and involved him in difficulties and
      disgraces which a more selfish man would have avoided. The pawning of the
      clothes, charged upon him as a crime by the grinding bookseller, and
      apparently admitted by him as one of &ldquo;the meannesses which poverty
      unavoidably brings with it,&rdquo; resulted, as we have shown, from a
      tenderness of heart and generosity of hand in which another man would have
      gloried; but these were such natural elements with him that he was
      unconscious of their merit. It is a pity that wealth does not oftener
      bring such &ldquo;meannesses&rdquo; in its train.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now let us be indulged in a few particulars about these lodgings in
      which Goldsmith was guilty of this thoughtless act of benevolence. They
      were in a very shabby house, No. 12, Green Arbor Court, between the Old
      Bailey and Fleet Market. An old woman was still living in 1820 who was a
      relative of the identical landlady whom Goldsmith relieved by the money
      received from the pawnbroker. She was a child about seven years of age at
      the time that the poet rented his apartment of her relative, and used
      frequently to be at the house in Green Arbor Court. She was drawn there,
      in a great measure, by the good-humored kindness of Goldsmith, who was
      always exceedingly fond of the society of children. He used to assemble
      those of the family in his room, give them cakes and sweetmeats, and set
      them dancing to the sound of his flute. He was very friendly to those
      around him, and cultivated a kind of intimacy with a watchmaker in the
      court, who possessed much native wit and humor. He passed most of the day,
      however, in his room, and only went out in the evenings. His days were no
      doubt devoted to the drudgery of the pen, and it would appear that he
      occasionally found the booksellers urgent taskmasters. On one occasion a
      visitor was shown up to his room, and immediately their voices were heard
      in high altercation, and the key was turned within the lock. The landlady,
      at first, was disposed to go to the assistance of her lodger; but a calm
      succeeding, she forbore to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the evening the door was unlocked; a supper ordered by the visitor
      from a neighboring tavern, and Goldsmith and his intrusive guest finished
      the evening in great good-humor. It was probably his old taskmaster
      Griffiths, whose press might have been wailing, and who found no other
      mode of getting a stipulated task from Goldsmith than by locking him in,
      and staying by him until it was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have a more particular account of these lodgings in Green Arbor
      Court from the Rev. Thomas Percy, afterward Bishop of Dromore, and
      celebrated for his relics of ancient poetry, his beautiful ballads, and
      other works. During an occasional visit to London, he was introduced to
      Goldsmith by Grainger, and ever after continued one of his most steadfast
      and valued friends. The following is his description of the poet&rsquo;s
      squalid apartment: &ldquo;I called on Goldsmith at his lodgings in March,
      1759, and found him writing his &lsquo;Inquiry&rsquo; in a miserable,
      dirty-looking room, in which there was but one chair; and when, from
      civility, he resigned it to me, he himself was obliged to sit in the
      window. While we were conversing together some one tapped gently at the
      door, and, being desired to come in, a poor, ragged little girl, of a very
      becoming demeanor, entered the room, and, dropping a courtesy, said,
      &lsquo;My mamma sends her compliments and begs the favor of you to lend
      her a chamber-pot full of coals.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are reminded in this anecdote of Goldsmith&rsquo;s picture of
      the lodgings of Beau Tibbs, and of the peep into the secrets of a
      makeshift establishment given to a visitor by the blundering old Scotch
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By this time we were arrived as high as the stairs would permit us
      to ascend, till we came to what he was facetiously pleased to call the
      first floor down the chimney; and, knocking at the door, a voice from
      within demanded &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; My conductor answered
      that it was him. But this not satisfying the querist, the voice again
      repeated the demand, to which he answered louder than before; and now the
      door was opened by an old woman with cautious reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we got in he welcomed me to his house with great ceremony;
      and, turning to the old woman, asked where was her lady. &lsquo;Good
      troth,&rsquo; replied she, in a peculiar dialect, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s
      washing your twa shirts at the next door, because they have taken an oath
      against lending the tub any longer.&rsquo; &lsquo;My two shirts,&rsquo;
      cried he, in a tone that faltered with confusion; &lsquo;what does the
      idiot mean?&rsquo; &lsquo;I ken what I mean weel enough,&rsquo; replied
      the other; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s washing your twa shirts at the next door,
      because&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;Fire and fury! no more of thy stupid
      explanations,&rsquo; cried he; &lsquo;go and inform her we have company.
      Were that Scotch hag to be forever in my family, she would never learn
      politeness, nor forget that absurd poisonous accent of hers, or testify
      the smallest specimen of breeding or high life; and yet it is very
      surprising, too, as I had her from a Parliament man, a friend of mine from
      the Highlands, one of the politest men in the world; but that&rsquo;s a
      secret.&rsquo;&rdquo; [Footnote: Citizen of the World, Letter iv.]
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us linger a little in Green Arbor Court, a place consecrated by the
      genius and the poverty of Goldsmith, but recently obliterated in the
      course of modern improvements. The writer of this memoir visited it not
      many years since on a literary pilgrimage, and may be excused for
      repeating a description of it which he has heretofore inserted in another
      publication. &ldquo;It then existed in its pristine state, and was a small
      square of tall and miserable houses, the very intestines of which seemed
      turned inside out, to judge from the old garments and frippery that
      fluttered from every window. It appeared to be a region of washerwomen,
      and lines were stretched about the little square, on which clothes were
      dangling to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as we entered the square, a scuffle took place between two
      viragoes about a disputed right to a washtub, and immediately the whole
      community was in a hubbub. Heads in mob caps popped out of every window,
      and such a clamor of tongues ensued that I was fain to stop my ears. Every
      Amazon took part with one or other of the disputants, and brandished her
      arms, dripping with soapsuds, and fired away from her window as from the
      embrasure of a fortress; while the screams of children nestled and cradled
      in every procreant chamber of this hive, waking with the noise, set up
      their shrill pipes to swell the general concert.&rdquo; [Footnote: Tales
      of a Traveler.]
    </p>
    <p>
      While in these forlorn quarters, suffering under extreme depression of
      spirits, caused by his failure at Surgeons&rsquo; Hall, the disappointment
      of his hopes, and his harsh collisions with Griffiths, Goldsmith wrote the
      following letter to his brother Henry, some parts of which are most
      touchingly mournful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR&mdash;Your punctuality in answering a man whose trade is
      writing is more than I had reason to expect; and yet you see me generally
      fill a whole sheet, which is all the recompense I can make for being so
      frequently troublesome. The behavior of Mr. Wells and Mr. Lawder is a
      little extraordinary. However, their answering neither you nor me is a
      sufficient indication of their disliking the employment which I assigned
      them. As their conduct is different from what I had expected, so I have
      made an alteration in mine. I shall, the beginning of next month, send
      over two hundred and fifty books, [Footnote: The Inquiry into Polite
      Literature. His previous remarks apply to the subscription.] which are all
      that I fancy can be well sold among you, and I would have you make some
      distinction in the persons who have subscribed. The money, which will
      amount to sixty pounds, may be left with Mr. Bradley as soon as possible.
      I am not certain but I shall quickly have occasion for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met with no disappointment with respect to my East India
      voyage, nor are my resolutions altered; though, at the same time, I must
      confess, it gives me some pain to think I am almost beginning the world at
      the age of thirty-one. Though I never had a day&rsquo;s sickness since I
      saw you, yet I am not that strong, active man you once knew me. You
      scarcely can conceive how much eight years of disappointment, anguish, and
      study have worn me down. If I remember right you are seven or eight years
      older than me, yet I dare venture to say, that, if a stranger saw Us both,
      he would pay me the honors of seniority. Imagine to yourself a pale,
      melancholy visage, with two great wrinkles between the eyebrows, with an
      eye disgustingly severe, and a big wig; and you may have a perfect picture
      of my present appearance. On the other hand, I conceive you as perfectly
      sleek and healthy, passing many a happy day among your own children or
      those who knew you a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I knew what it was to be a man, this is a pleasure I have not
      known. I have passed my days among a parcel of cool, designing beings, and
      have contracted all their suspicious manner in my own behavior. I should
      actually be as unfit for the society of my friends at home, as I detest
      that which I am obliged to partake of here. I can now neither partake of
      the pleasure of a revel, nor contribute to raise its jollity. I can
      neither laugh nor drink; have contracted a hesitating, disagreeable manner
      of speaking, and a visage that looks ill-nature itself; in short, I have
      thought myself into a settled melancholy, and an utter disgust of all that
      life brings with it. Whence this romantic turn that all our family are
      possessed with? Whence this love for every place and every country but
      that in which we reside&mdash;for every occupation but our own? this
      desire of fortune, and yet this eagerness to dissipate? I perceive, my
      dear sir, that I am at intervals for indulging this splenetic manner, and
      following my own taste, regardless of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reasons you have given me for breeding up your son a scholar
      are judicious and convincing; I should, however, be glad to know for what
      particular profession he is designed If he be assiduous and divested of
      strong passions (for passions in youth always lead to pleasure), he may do
      very well in your college; for it must be owned that the industrious poor
      have good encouragement there, perhaps better than in any other in Europe.
      But if he has ambition, strong passions, and an exquisite sensibility of
      contempt, do not send him there, unless you have no other trade for him
      but your own. It is impossible to conceive how much may be done by proper
      education at home. A boy, for instance, who understands perfectly well
      Latin, French, arithmetic, and the principles of the civil law, and can
      write a fine hand, has an education that may qualify him for any
      undertaking; and these parts of learning should be carefully inculcated,
      let him be designed for whatever calling he will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all things, let him never touch a romance or novel; these
      paint beauty in colors more charming than nature, and describe happiness
      that man never tastes. How delusive, how destructive, are those pictures
      of consummate bliss! They teach the youthful mind to sigh after beauty and
      happiness that never existed; to despise the little good which fortune has
      mixed in our cup, by expecting more than she ever gave; and, in general,
      take the word of a man who has seen the world, and who has studied human
      nature more by experience than precept; take my word for it, I say, that
      books teach us very little of the world. The greatest merit in a state of
      poverty would only serve to make the possessor ridiculous&mdash;may
      distress, but cannot relieve him. Frugality, and even avarice, in the
      lower orders&rsquo; of mankind, are true ambition. These afford the only
      ladder for the poor to rise to preferment. Teach then, my dear sir, to
      your son, thrift and economy. Let his poor wandering uncle&rsquo;s example
      be placed before his eyes. I had learned from books to be disinterested
      and generous before I was taught from experience the necessity of being
      prudent. I had contracted the habits and notions of a philosopher, while I
      was exposing myself to the approaches of insidious cunning; and often by
      being, even with my narrow finances, charitable to excess, I forgot the
      rules of justice, and placed myself in the very situation of the wretch
      who thanked me for my bounty. When I am in the remotest part of the world,
      tell him this, and perhaps he may improve from my example. But I find
      myself again falling into my gloomy habits of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother, I am informed, is almost blind; even though I had the
      utmost inclination to return home, under such circumstances I could not,
      for to behold her in distress without a capacity of relieving her from it
      would add much to my splenetic habit. Your last letter was much too short;
      it should have answered some queries I had made in my former. Just sit
      down as I do, and write forward until you have filled all your paper. It
      requires no thought, at least from the ease with which my own sentiments
      rise when they are addressed to you. For, believe me, my head has no share
      in all I write; my heart dictates the whole. Pray give my love to Bob
      Bryanton, and entreat him from me not to drink. My dear sir, give me some
      account about poor Jenny. [Footnote: His sister, Mrs. Johnston; her
      marriage, like that of Mrs. Hodson, was private, but in pecuniary matters
      much less fortunate.] Yet her husband loves her; if so, she cannot be
      unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not whether I should tell you&mdash;yet why should I conceal
      these trifles, or, indeed, anything from you? There is a book of mine will
      be published in a few days; the life of a very extraordinary man; no less
      than the great Voltaire. You know already by the title that it is no more
      than a catchpenny. However, I spent but four weeks on the whole
      performance, for which I received twenty pounds. When published, I shall
      take some method of conveying it to you, unless you may think it dear of
      the postage, which may amount to four or five shillings. However, I fear
      you will not find an equivalent of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your last letter, I repeat it, was too short; you should have given
      me your opinion of the design of the heroi-comical poem which I sent you.
      You remember I intended to introduce the hero of the poem as lying in a
      paltry alehouse. You may take the following specimen of the manner, which.
      I flatter myself is quite original. The room in which he lies may be
      described somewhat in this way:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;The window, patched with paper, lent a ray
  That feebly show&rsquo;d the state in which he lay;
  The sanded floor that grits beneath the tread,
  The humid wall with paltry pictures spread;
  The game of goose was there exposed to view,
  And the twelve rules the royal martyr drew;
  The Seasons, framed with listing, found a place.
  And Prussia&rsquo;s monarch show&rsquo;d his lampblack face.
  The morn was cold: he views with keen desire
  A rusty grate unconscious of a fire;
  An unpaid reckoning on the frieze was scored,
  And five crack&rsquo;d teacups dress&rsquo;d the chimney board.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now imagine, after his soliloquy, the landlord to make his
      appearance in order to dun him for the reckoning:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Not with that face, so servile and so gay,
  That welcomes every stranger that can pay:
  With sulky eye he smoked the patient man,
  hen pull&rsquo;d his breeches tight, and thus began,&rsquo; etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      [Footnote: The projected poem, of which the above were specimens, appears
      never to have been completed.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is taken, you see, from nature. It is a good remark of
      Montaigne&rsquo;s, that the wisest men often hare friends with whom they
      do not care how much they play the fool. Take my present follies as
      instances of my regard. Poetry is a much easier and more agreeable species
      of composition than prose; and could a man live by it, it were not
      unpleasant employment to be a poet. I am resolved to leave no space,
      though I should fill it up only by telling you, what you very well know
      already, I mean that I am your most affectionate friend and brother,

    <h3>
      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Life of Voltaire, alluded to in the latter part of the preceding
      letter, was the literary job undertaken to satisfy the demands of
      Griffiths. It was to hare preceded a translation of the Henriade, by Ned
      Purdon, Goldsmith&rsquo;s old schoolmate, now a Grub Street writer, who
      starved rather than lived by the exercise of his pen, and often tasked
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s scanty means to relieve his hunger. His miserable career
      was summed up by our poet in the following lines written some years after
      the tune we are treating of, on hearing that he had suddenly dropped dead
      in Smithfield:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here lies poor Ned Purdon, from misery freed,
    Who long was a bookseller&rsquo;s hack;
  He led such a damnable life in this world,
    I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll wish to come back.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The memoir and translation, though advertised to form a volume, were not
      published together; but appeared separately in a magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the heroi-comical poem, also, cited in the foregoing letter, it
      appears to have perished in embryo. Had it been brought to maturity we
      should have had further traits of autobiography, the room already
      described was probably his own squalid quarters in Green Arbor Court; and
      in a subsequent morsel of the poem we have the poet himself, under the
      euphonious name of Scroggin:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Where the Red Lion peering o&rsquo;er the way,
  Invites each passing stranger that can pay;
  Where Calvert&rsquo;s butt and Parson&rsquo;s black champagne
  Regale the drabs and bloods of Drury Lane:
  There, in a lonely room, from bailiffs snug,
  The muse found Scroggin stretch&rsquo;d beneath a rug;
  A nightcap deck&rsquo;d his brows instead of bay,
  A cap by night, a stocking all the day!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is to be regretted that this poetical conception was not carried out;
      like the author&rsquo;s other writings, it might have abounded with
      pictures of life and touches of nature drawn from his own observation and
      experience, and mellowed by his own humane and tolerant spirit; and might
      have been a worthy companion or rather contrast to his Traveler and
      Deserted Village, and have remained in the language a first-rate specimen
      of the mock-heroic.

      much stress, on which he at one time had calculated to defray the expenses
      of his outfit to India, and to which he had adverted in his correspondence
      with Griffiths, made its appearance. It was published by the Dodsleys, and
      entitled An Inquiry into the Present State of Polite Learning in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the present day, when the whole field of contemporary literature is so
      widely surveyed and amply discussed, and when the current productions of
      every country are constantly collated and ably criticised, a treatise like
      that of Goldsmith would be considered as extremely limited and
      unsatisfactory; but at that time it possessed novelty in its views and
      wideness in its scope, and being indued with the peculiar charm of style
      inseparable from the author, it commanded public attention and a
      profitable sale. As it was the most important production that had yet come
      from Goldsmith&rsquo;s pen, he was anxious to have the credit of it; yet
      it appeared without his name on the title-page. The authorship, however,
      was well known throughout the world of letters, and the author had now
      grown into sufficient literary importance to become an object of hostility
      to the underlings of the press. One of the most virulent attacks upon him
      was in a criticism on this treatise, and appeared in the &ldquo;Monthly
      Review,&rdquo; to which he himself had been recently a contributor. It
      slandered him as a man while it decried him as an author, and accused him,
      by innuendo, of &ldquo;laboring under the infamy of having, by the vilest
      and meanest actions, forfeited all pretensions to honor and honesty,&rdquo;
      and of practicing &ldquo;those acts which bring the sharper to the cart&rsquo;s
      tail or the pillory.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that the &ldquo;Review&rdquo; was owned by Griffiths
      the bookseller, with whom Goldsmith had recently had a misunderstanding.
      The criticism, therefore, was no doubt dictated by the lingerings of
      resentment; and the imputations upon Goldsmith&rsquo;s character for honor
      and honesty, and the vile and mean actions hinted at, could only allude to
      the unfortunate pawning of the clothes. All this, too, was after Griffiths
      had received the affecting letter from Goldsmith, drawing a picture of his
      poverty and perplexities, and after the latter had made him a literary
      compensation. Griffiths, in fact, was sensible of the falsehood and
      extravagance of the attack, and tried to exonerate himself by declaring
      that the criticism was written by a person in his employ; but we see no
      difference in atrocity between him who wields the knife and him who hires
      the cut-throat. It may be well, however, in passing, to bestow our mite of
      notoriety upon the miscreant who launched the slander. He deserves it for
      a long course of dastardly and venomous attacks, not merely upon
      Goldsmith, but upon most of the successful authors of the day. His name
      was Kenrick. He was originally a mechanic, but, possessing some degree of
      talent and industry, applied himself to literature as a profession. This
      he pursued for many years, and tried his hand in every department of prose
      and poetry; he wrote plays and satires, philosophical tracts, critical
      dissertations, and works on philology; nothing from his pen ever rose to
      first-rate excellence, or gained him a popular name, though he received
      from some university the degree of Doctor of Laws. Dr. Johnson
      characterized his literary career in one short sentence. &ldquo;Sir, he is
      one of the many who have made themselves <i>public</i> without making
      themselves <i>known</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soured by his own want of success, jealous of the success of others, his
      natural irritability of temper increased by habits of intemperance, he at
      length abandoned himself to the practice of reviewing, and became one of
      the Ishmaelites of the press. In this his malignant bitterness soon gave
      him a notoriety which his talents had never been able to attain. We shall
      dismiss him for the present with the following sketch of him by the hand
      of one of his contemporaries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Dreaming of genius which he never had,
  Half wit, half fool, half critic, and half mad;
  Seizing, like Shirley, on the poet&rsquo;s lyre,
  With all his rage, but not one spark of fire;
  Eager for slaughter, and resolved to tear
  From other&rsquo;s brows that wreath he most not wear
  Next Kenrick came: all furious and replete
  With brandy, malice, pertness, and conceit;
  Unskill&rsquo;d in classic lore, through envy blind
  To all that&rsquo;s beauteous, learned, or refined;
  For faults alone behold the savage prowl,
  With reason&rsquo;s offal glut his ravening soul;
  Pleased with his prey, its inmost blood he drinks,
  And mumbles, paws, and turns it&mdash;till it stinks.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The British press about this time was extravagantly fruitful of periodical
      publications. That &ldquo;oldest inhabitant,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s
      Magazine,&rdquo; almost coeval with St. John&rsquo;s gate which graced its
      title-page, had long been elbowed by magazines and reviews of all kinds;
      Johnson&rsquo;s Rambler had introduced the fashion of periodical essays,
      which he had followed up in his Adventurer and Idler. Imitations had
      sprung up on every side, under every variety of name; until British
      literature was entirely overrun by a weedy and transient efflorescence.
      Many of these rival periodicals choked each other almost at the outset,
      and few of them have escaped oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith wrote for some of the most successful, such as the &ldquo;Bee,&rdquo;
      the &ldquo;Busy-Body,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lady&rsquo;s Magazine.&rdquo;
      His essays, though characterized by his delightful style, his pure,
      benevolent morality, and his mellow, unobtrusive humor, did not produce
      equal effect at first with more garish writings of infinitely less value;
      they did not &ldquo;strike,&rdquo; as it is termed; but they had that rare
      and enduring merit which rises in estimation on every perusal. They
      gradually stole upon the heart of the public, were copied into numerous
      contemporary publications, and now they are garnered up among the choice
      productions of British literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his Inquiry into the State of Polite Learning, Goldsmith had given
      offense to David Garrick, at that time the autocrat of the Drama, and was
      doomed to experience its effect. A clamor had been raised against Garrick
      for exercising a despotism over the stage, and bringing forward nothing
      but old plays to the exclusion of original productions. Walpole joined in
      this charge. &ldquo;Garrick,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is treating the town
      as it deserves and likes to be treated; with scenes, fireworks, and <i>his
      own writings</i>. A good new play I never expect to see more; nor have
      seen since the Provoked Husband, which came out when I was at school.&rdquo;
      Goldsmith, who was extremely fond of the theater, and felt the evils of
      this system, inveighed in his treatise against the wrongs experienced by
      authors at the hands of managers. &ldquo;Our poet&rsquo;s performance,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;must undergo a process truly chemical before it is
      presented to the public. It must be tried in the manager&rsquo;s fire;
      strained through a licenser, suffer from repeated corrections, till it may
      be a mere <i>caput mortuum</i> when it arrives before the public.&rdquo;
      Again. &ldquo;Getting a play on even in three or four years is a privilege
      reserved only for the happy few who have the arts of courting the manager
      as well as the muse; who have adulation to please his vanity, powerful
      patrons to support their merit, or money to indemnify disappointment. Our
      Saxon ancestors had but one name for a wit and a witch. I will not dispute
      the propriety of uniting those characters then; but the man who under
      present discouragements ventures to write for the stage, whatever claim he
      may have to the appellation of a wit, at least has no right to be called a
      conjurer.&rdquo; But a passage which perhaps touched more sensibly than
      all the rest on the sensibilities of Garrick was the following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no particular spleen against the fellow who sweeps the stage
      with the besom, or the hero who brushes it with his train. It were a
      matter of indifference to me whether our heroines are in keeping, or our
      candle snuffers burn their fingers, did not such make a great part of
      public care and polite conversation. Our actors assume all that state off
      the stage which they do on it; and, to use an expression borrowed from the
      green room, every one is <i>up</i> in his part. I am sorry to say it, they
      seem to forget their real characters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These strictures were considered by Garrick as intended for himself, and
      they were rankling in his mind when Goldsmith waited upon him and
      solicited his vote for the vacant secretaryship of the Society of Arts, of
      which the manager was a member. Garrick, puffed up by his dramatic renown
      and his intimacy with the great, and knowing Goldsmith only by his budding
      reputation, may not have considered him of sufficient importance to be
      conciliated. In reply to his solicitations, he observed that he could
      hardly expect his friendly exertions after the unprovoked attack he had
      made upon his management. Goldsmith replied that he had indulged in no
      personalities, and had only spoken what he believed to be the truth. He
      made no further apology nor application; failed to get the appointment,
      and considered Garrick his enemy. In the second edition of his treatise he
      expunged or modified the passages which had given the manager offense; but
      though the author and actor became intimate in after years, this false
      step at the outset of their intercourse was never forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Goldsmith engaged with Dr. Smollett, who was about to
      launch the &ldquo;British Magazine.&rdquo; Smollett was a complete schemer
      and speculator in literature, and intent upon enterprises that had money
      rather than reputation in view. Goldsmith has a good-humored hit at this
      propensity in one of his papers in the &ldquo;Bee,&rdquo; in which he
      represents Johnson, Hume, and others taking seats in the stagecoach bound
      for Fame, while Smollett prefers that destined for Riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another prominent employer of Goldsmith was Mr. John Newbery, who engaged
      him to contribute occasional essays to a newspaper entitled the &ldquo;Public
      Ledger,&rdquo; which made its first appearance on the 12th of January,
      1760. His most valuable and characteristic contributions to this paper
      were his Chinese Letters, subsequently modified into the Citizen of the
      World. These lucubrations attracted general attention; they were reprinted
      in the various periodical publications of the day, and met with great
      applause. The name of the author, however, was as yet but little known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being now in easier circumstances, and in the receipt of frequent sums
      from the booksellers, Goldsmith, about the middle of 1760, emerged from
      his dismal abode in Green Arbor Court, and took respectable apartments in
      Wine-Office Court, Fleet Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he continued to look back with considerate benevolence to the poor
      hostess, whose necessities he had relieved by pawning his gala coat, for
      we are told that &ldquo;he often supplied her with food from his own
      table, and visited her frequently with the sole purpose to be kind to her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He now became a member of a debating club, called the Robin Hood, which
      used to meet near Temple Bar, and in which Burke, while yet a Temple
      student, had first tried his powers. Goldsmith spoke here occasionally,
      and is recorded in the Robin Hood archives as &ldquo;a candid disputant,
      with a clear head and an honest heart, though coming but seldom to the
      society.&rdquo; His relish was for clubs of a more social, jovial nature,
      and he was never fond of argument. An amusing anecdote is told of his
      first introduction to the club by Samuel Derrick, an Irish acquaintance of
      some humor. On entering, Goldsmith was struck with the self-important
      appearance of the chairman ensconced in a large gilt chair. &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;must be the Lord Chancellor at least.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,
      no,&rdquo; replied Derrick, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only master of the <i>rolls</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;The
      chairman was a <i>baker</i>.

      CHAPTER TWELVE

    <p>
      NEW LODGINGS&mdash;VISITS OF CEREMONY&mdash;HANGERS-ON&mdash;PILKINGTON
      AND THE WHITE MOUSE&mdash;INTRODUCTION TO DR. JOHNSON&mdash;DAVIES AND HIS
      BOOKSHOP&mdash;PRETTY MRS. DAVIES&mdash;FOOTE AND HIS PROJECTS&mdash;CRITICISM
      OF THE CUDGEL
    </p>
    <p>
      In his new lodgings in Wine-Office Court, Goldsmith began to receive
      visits of ceremony and to entertain his literary friends. Among the latter
      he now numbered several names of note, such as Guthrie, Murphy,
      Christopher Smart, and Bickerstaff. He had also a numerous class of
      hangers-on, the small-fry of literature; who, knowing his almost utter
      incapacity to refuse a pecuniary request, were apt, now that he was
      considered flush, to levy continual taxes upon his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among others, one Pilkington, an old college acquaintance, but now a
      shifting adventurer, duped him in the most ludicrous manner. He called on
      him with a face full of perplexity. A lady of the first rank having an
      extraordinary fancy for curious animals, for which she was willing to give
      enormous sums, he had procured a couple of white mice to be forwarded to
      her from India. They were actually on board of a ship in the river. Her
      grace had been apprised of their arrival, and was all impatience to see
      them. Unfortunately, he had no cage to put them in, nor clothes to appear
      in before a lady of her rank. Two guineas would be sufficient for his
      purpose, but where were two guineas to be procured!
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple heart of Goldsmith was touched; but, alas! he had but half a
      guinea in his pocket. It was unfortunate, but after a pause his friend
      suggested, with some hesitation, &ldquo;that money might be raised upon
      his watch; it would but be the loan of a few hours.&rdquo; So said, so
      done; the watch was delivered to the worthy Mr. Pilkington to be pledged
      at a neighboring pawnbroker&rsquo;s, but nothing further was ever seen of
      him, the watch, or the white mice. The next that Goldsmith heard of the
      poor shifting scapegrace, he was on his deathbed, starving with want, upon
      which, forgetting or forgiving the trick he had played upon him, he sent
      him a guinea. Indeed, he used often to relate with great humor the
      foregoing anecdote of his credulity, and was ultimately in some degree
      indemnified by its suggesting to him the amusing little story of Prince
      Bonbennin and the White House in the Citizen of the World.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this year Goldsmith became personally acquainted with Dr. Johnson,
      toward whom he was drawn by strong sympathies, though their natures were
      widely different. Both had struggled from early life with poverty, but had
      struggled in different ways. Goldsmith, buoyant, heedless, sanguine,
      tolerant of evils and easily pleased, had shifted along by any temporary
      expedient; cast down at every turn, but rising again with indomitable
      good-humor, and still carried forward by his talent at hoping. Johnson,
      melancholy, and hypochondriacal, and prone to apprehend the worst, yet
      sternly resolute to battle with and conquer it, had made his way doggedly
      and gloomily, but with a noble principle of self-reliance and a disregard
      of foreign aid. Both had been irregular at college, Goldsmith, as we have
      shown, from the levity of his nature and his social and convivial habits;
      Johnson, from his acerbity and gloom. When, in after life, the latter
      heard himself spoken of as gay and frolicsome at college, because he had
      joined in some riotous excesses there, &ldquo;Ah, sir!&rdquo; replied he,
      &ldquo;I was mad and violent. It was bitterness which they mistook for
      frolic. <i>I was miserably poor, and I thought to fight my way by my
      literature and my wit</i>. So I disregarded all power and all authority.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s poverty was never accompanied by bitterness; but neither
      was it accompanied by the guardian pride which kept Johnson from falling
      into the degrading shifts of poverty. Goldsmith had an unfortunate
      facility at borrowing, and helping himself along by the contributions of
      his friends; no doubt trusting, in his hopeful way, of one day making
      retribution. Johnson never hoped, and therefore never borrowed. In his
      sternest trials he proudly bore the ills he could not master. In his
      youth, when some unknown friend, seeing his shoes completely worn out,
      left a new pair at his chamber door, he disdained to accept the boon, and
      threw them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though like Goldsmith an immethodical student, he had imbibed deeper
      draughts of knowledge, and made himself a riper scholar. While Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      happy constitution and genial humors carried him abroad into sunshine and
      enjoyment, Johnson&rsquo;s physical infirmities and mental gloom drove him
      upon himself; to the resources of reading and meditation; threw a deeper
      though darker enthusiasm into his mind, and stored a retentive memory with
      all kinds of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several years of youth passed in the country as usher, teacher, and
      an occasional writer for the press, Johnson, when twenty-eight years of
      age, came up to London with a half-written tragedy in his pocket; and
      David Garrick, late his pupil, and several years his junior, as a
      companion, both poor and penniless, both, like Goldsmith, seeking their
      fortune in the metropolis. &ldquo;We rode and tied,&rdquo; said Garrick
      sportively in after years of prosperity, when he spoke of their humble
      wayfaring. &ldquo;I came to London,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;with
      twopence halfpenny in my pocket.&rdquo; &ldquo;Eh, what&rsquo;s that you
      say?&rdquo; cried Garrick, &ldquo;with twopence halfpenny in your pocket?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Why, yes; I came with twopence halfpenny in <i>my</i> pocket, and
      thou, Davy, with but three halfpence in thine.&rdquo; Nor was there much
      exaggeration in the picture; for so poor were they in purse and credit
      that after their arrival they had, with difficulty, raised five pounds, by
      giving their joint note to a bookseller in the Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, many years had Johnson gone on obscurely in London, &ldquo;fighting
      his way by his literature and his wit&rdquo;; enduring all the hardships
      and miseries of a Grub Street writer; so destitute at one time that he and
      Savage the poet had walked all night about St. James&rsquo;s Square, both
      too poor to pay for a night&rsquo;s lodging, yet both full of poetry and
      patriotism, and determined to stand by their country; so shabby in dress
      at another time, that when he dined at Cave&rsquo;s, his bookseller, when
      there was prosperous company, he could not make his appearance at table,
      but had his dinner handed to him behind a screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet through all the long and dreary struggle, often diseased in mind as
      well as in body, he had been resolutely self-dependent, and proudly
      self-respectful; he had fulfilled his college vow, he had &ldquo;fought
      his way by his literature and his wit.&rdquo; His Rambler and Idler had
      made him the great moralist of the age, and his Dictionary and History of
      the English Language, that stupendous monument of individual labor, had
      excited the admiration of the learned world. He was now at the head of
      intellectual society; and had become as distinguished by his
      conversational as his literary powers. He had become as much an autocrat
      in his sphere as his fellow-wayfarer and adventurer Garrick had become of
      the stage, and had been humorously dubbed by Smollett, &ldquo;The Great
      Cham of Literature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Dr. Johnson, when on the 31st of May, 1761, he was to make his
      appearance as a guest at a literary supper given by Goldsmith, to a
      numerous party at his new lodgings in Wine-Office Court. It was the
      opening of their acquaintance. Johnson had felt and acknowledged the merit
      of Goldsmith as an author, and been pleased by the honorable mention made
      of himself in the &ldquo;Bee&rdquo; and the Chinese Letters. Dr. Percy
      called upon Johnson to take him to Goldsmith&rsquo;s lodgings; he found
      Johnson arrayed with unusual care in a new suit of clothes, a new hat, and
      a well-powdered wig; and could not but notice his uncommon spruceness.
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;I hear that Goldsmith, who
      is a very great sloven, justifies his disregard of cleanliness and decency
      by quoting my practice, and I am desirous this night to show him a better
      example.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The acquaintance thus commenced ripened into intimacy in the course of
      frequent meetings at the shop of Davies, the bookseller, in Russell
      Street, Covent Garden. As this was one of the great literary gossiping
      places of the day, especially to the circle over which Johnson presided,
      it is worthy of some specification. Mr. Thomas Davies, noted in after
      times as the biographer of Garrick, had originally been on the stage, and
      though a small man had enacted tyrannical tragedy, with a pomp and
      magniloquence beyond his size, if we may trust the description given of
      him by Churchill in the Rosciad:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Statesman all over&mdash;in plots famous grown,
  <i>He mouths a sentence as ours mouth a bone</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This unlucky sentence is said to have crippled him in the midst of his
      tragic career, and ultimately to have driven him from the stage. He
      carried into the bookselling craft somewhat of the grandiose manner of the
      stage, and was prone to be mouthy and magniloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Churchill had intimated, that while on the stage he was more noted for his
      pretty wife than his good acting:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;With him came mighty Davies; on my life,
  That fellow has a very pretty wife.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty Mrs. Davies,&rdquo; continued to be the loadstar of his
      fortunes. Her tea-table became almost as much a literary lounge as her
      husband&rsquo;s shop. She found favor in the eyes of the Ursa Major of
      literature by her winning ways, as she poured out for him cups without
      stint of his favorite beverage. Indeed it is suggested that she was one
      leading cause of his habitual resort to this literary haunt. Others were
      drawn thither for the sake of Johnson&rsquo;s conversation, and thus it
      became a resort of many of the notorieties of the day. Here might
      occasionally be seen Bennet Langton, George Stevens, Dr. Percy, celebrated
      for his ancient ballads, and sometimes Warburton in prelatic state.
      Garrick resorted to it for a time, but soon grew shy and suspicious,
      declaring that most of the authors who frequented Mr. Davies&rsquo; shop
      went merely to abuse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foote, the Aristophanes of the day, was a frequent visitor; his broad face
      beaming with fun and waggery, and his satirical eye ever on the lookout
      for characters and incidents for his farces. He was struck with the odd
      habits and appearance of Johnson and Goldsmith, now so often brought
      together in Davies&rsquo; shop. He was about to put on the stage a farce
      called The Orators, intended as a hit at the Robin Hood debating club, and
      resolved to show up the two doctors in it for the entertainment of the
      town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the common price of an oak stick, sir?&rdquo; said Johnson
      to Davies. &ldquo;Sixpence,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Why, then, sir,
      give me leave to send your servant to purchase a shilling one. I&rsquo;ll
      have a double quantity; for I am told Foote means to take me off, as he
      calls it, and I am determined the fellow shall not do it with impunity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Foote had no disposition to undergo the criticism of the cudgel wielded by
      such potent hands, so the farce of The Orators appeared without the
      caricatures of the lexicographer and the essayist.

    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his growing success, Goldsmith continued to consider
      literature a mere makeshift, and his Vagrant imagination teemed with
      schemes and plans of a grand but indefinite nature. One was for visiting
      the East and exploring the interior of Asia. He had, as has been before
      observed, a vague notion that valuable discoveries were to be made there,
      and many useful inventions in the arts brought back to the stock of
      European knowledge. &ldquo;Thus, in Siberian Tartary,&rdquo; observes he
      in one of his writings, &ldquo;the natives extract a strong spirit from
      milk, which is a secret probably unknown to the chemists of Europe. In the
      most savage parts of India they are possessed of the secret of dying
      vegetable substances scarlet, and that of refining lead into a metal
      which, for hardness and color, is little inferior to silver.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith adds a description of the kind of person suited to such an
      enterprise, in which he evidently had himself in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should be a man of philosophical turn, one apt to deduce
      consequences of general utility from particular occurrences; neither
      swollen with pride, nor hardened by prejudice; neither wedded to one
      particular system, nor instructed only in one particular science; neither
      wholly a botanist, nor quite an antiquarian; his mind should be tinctured
      with miscellaneous knowledge, and his manners humanized by an intercourse
      with men. He should be in some measure an enthusiast to the design; fond
      of traveling, from a rapid imagination and an innate love of change;
      furnished with a body capable of sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not
      easily terrified at danger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1761, when Lord Bute became prime minister on the accession of George
      the Third, Goldsmith drew up a memorial on the subject, suggesting the
      advantages to be derived from a mission to those countries solely for
      useful and scientific purposes; and, the better to insure success, he
      preceded his application to the government by an ingenious essay to the
      same effect in the &ldquo;Public Ledger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His memorial and his essay were fruitless, his project most probably being
      deemed the dream of a visionary. Still it continued to haunt his mind, and
      he would often talk of making an expedition to Aleppo some time or other,
      when his means were greater, to inquire into the arts peculiar to the
      East, and to bring home such as might be valuable. Johnson, who knew how
      little poor Goldsmith was fitted by scientific lore for this favorite
      scheme of his fancy, scoffed at the project when it was mentioned to him.
      &ldquo;Of all men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Goldsmith is the most unfit to
      go out upon such an inquiry, for he is utterly ignorant of such arts as we
      already possess, and, consequently, could not know what would be
      accessions to our present stock of mechanical knowledge. Sir, he would
      bring home a grinding barrow, which you see in every street in London, and
      think that he had furnished a wonderful improvement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His connection with Newbery the bookseller now led him into a variety of
      temporary jobs, such as a pamphlet on the Cock-lane Ghost, a Life of Beau
      Nash, the famous Master of Ceremonies at Bath, etc.; one of the best
      things for his fame, however, was the remodeling and republication of his
      Chinese Letters under the title of The Citizen of the World, a work which
      has long since taken its merited stand among the classics of the English
      language. &ldquo;Few works,&rdquo; it has been observed by one of his
      biographers, &ldquo;exhibit a nicer perception, or more delicate
      delineation of life and manners. Wit, humor, and sentiment pervade every
      page; the vices and follies of the day are touched with the most playful
      and diverting satire; and English characteristics, in endless variety, are
      hit off with the pencil of a master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In seeking materials for his varied views of life, he often mingled in
      strange scenes and got involved in whimsical situations. In the summer of
      1762 he was one of the thousands who went to see the Cherokee chiefs, whom
      he mentions in one of his writings. The Indians made their appearance in
      grand costume, hideously painted and besmeared. In the course of the visit
      Goldsmith made one of the chiefs a present, who, in the ecstasy of his
      gratitude, gave him an embrace that left his face well bedaubed with oil
      and red ocher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of 1762 he removed to &ldquo;merry Islington,&rdquo; then
      a country village, though now swallowed up in omnivorous London. He went
      there for the benefit of country air, his health being injured by literary
      application and confinement, and to be near his chief employer, Mr.
      Newbery, who resided in the Canonbury House. In this neighborhood he used
      to take his solitary rambles, sometimes extending his walks to the gardens
      of the White Conduit House, so famous among the essayists of the last
      century. While strolling one day in these gardens, he met three females of
      the family of a respectable tradesman to whom he was under some
      obligation. With his prompt disposition to oblige, he conducted them about
      the garden, treated them to tea, and ran up a bill in the most open-handed
      manner imaginable; it was only when he came to pay that he found himself
      in one of his old dilemmas&mdash;he had not the wherewithal in his pocket.
      A scene of perplexity now took place between him and the waiter, in the
      midst of which came up some of his acquaintances, in whose eyes he wished
      to stand particularly well. This completed his mortification. There was no
      concealing the awkwardness of his position. The sneers of the waiter
      revealed it. His acquaintances amused themselves for some tune at his
      expense, professing their inability to relieve him. When, however, they
      had enjoyed their banter, the waiter was paid, and poor Goldsmith enabled
      to convoy off the ladies with flying colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the various productions thrown off by him for the booksellers during
      this growing period of his reputation was a small work in two volumes,
      entitled The History of England, in a Series of Letters from a Nobleman to
      his Son. It was digested from Hume, Rapin, Carte, and Kennet. These
      authors he would read in the morning; make a few notes; ramble with a
      friend into the country about the skirts of &ldquo;merry Islington&rdquo;;
      return to a temperate dinner and cheerful evening; and, before going to
      bed, write off what had arranged itself in his head from the studies of
      the morning. In this way he took a more general view of the subject, and
      wrote in a more free and fluent style than if he had been mousing at the
      time among authorities. The work, like many others written by him in the
      earlier part of his literary career, was anonymous. Some attributed it to
      Lord Chesterfield, others to Lord Orrery, and others to Lord Lyttelton.
      The latter seemed pleased to be the putative father, and never disowned
      the bantling thus laid at his door; and well might he have been proud to
      be considered capable of producing what has been well pronounced &ldquo;the
      most finished and elegant summary of English history in the same compass
      that has been or is likely to be written.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reputation of Goldsmith, it will be perceived, grew slowly; he was
      known and estimated by a few; but he had not those brilliant though
      fallacious qualities which flash upon the public and excite loud but
      transient applause. His works were more read than cited; and the charm of
      style, for which he was especially noted, was more apt to be felt than
      talked about. He used often to repine, in a half-humorous, half-querulous
      manner, at his tardiness in gaining the laurels which he felt to be his
      due. &ldquo;The public,&rdquo; he would exclaim, &ldquo;will never do me
      justice; whenever I write anything they make a point to know nothing about
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      About the beginning of 1763 he became acquainted with Boswell, whose
      literary gossipings were destined to have a deleterious effect upon his
      reputation. Boswell was at that time a young man, light, buoyant, pushing,
      and presumptuous. He had a morbid passion for mingling in the society of
      men noted for wit and learning, and had just arrived from Scotland, bent
      upon making his way into the literary circles of the metropolis. An
      intimacy with Dr. Johnson, the great literary luminary of the day, was the
      crowning object of his aspiring and somewhat ludicrous ambition. He
      expected to meet him, at a dinner to which he was invited at Davies the
      bookseller&rsquo;s, but was disappointed. Goldsmith was present, but he
      was not as yet sufficiently renowned to excite the reverence of Boswell.
      &ldquo;At this time,&rdquo; says he in his notes, &ldquo;I think he had
      published nothing with his name, though it was pretty generally understood
      that one Dr. Goldsmith was the author of An Inquiry into the Present State
      of Polite Learning in Europe, and of The Citizen of the World, a series of
      letters supposed to be written from London by a Chinese.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A conversation took place at table between Goldsmith and Mr. Robert
      Dodsley, compiler of the well-known collection of modern poetry, as to the
      merits of the current poetry of the day. Goldsmith declared there was none
      of superior merit. Dodsley cited his own collection in proof of the
      contrary. &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we can boast of no
      palaces nowadays, like Dryden&rsquo;s Ode to St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day, but
      we have villages composed of very pretty houses.&rdquo; Goldsmith,
      however, maintained that there was nothing above mediocrity, an opinion in
      which Johnson, to whom it was repeated, concurred, and with reason, for
      the era was one of the dead levels of British poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell has made no note of this conversation; he was a Unitarian in his
      literary devotion, and disposed to worship none but Johnson. Little Davies
      endeavored to console him for his disappointment, and to stay the stomach
      of his curiosity, by giving him imitations of the great lexicographer;
      mouthing his words, rolling his head, and assuming as ponderous a manner
      as his petty person would permit. Boswell was shortly afterward made happy
      by an introduction to Johnson, of whom he became the obsequious satellite.
      From him he likewise imbibed a more favorable opinion of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      merits, though he was fain to consider them derived in a great measure
      from his Magnus Apollo. &ldquo;He had sagacity enough,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;to cultivate assiduously the acquaintance of Johnson, and his
      faculties were gradually enlarged by the contemplation of such a model. To
      me and many others it appeared that he studiously copied the manner of
      Johnson, though, indeed, upon a smaller scale.&rdquo; So on another
      occasion he calls him &ldquo;one of the brightest ornaments of the
      Johnsonian school.&rdquo; &ldquo;His respectful attachment to Johnson,&rdquo;
      adds he, &ldquo;was then at its height; for big own literary reputation
      had not yet distinguished him so much as to excite a vain desire of
      competition with his great master.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What beautiful instances does the garrulous Boswell give of the goodness
      of heart of Johnson, and the passing homage to it by Goldsmith. They were
      speaking of a Mr. Levett, long an inmate of Johnson&rsquo;s house and a
      dependent on his bounty; but who, Boswell thought, must be an irksome
      charge upon him. &ldquo;He is poor and honest,&rdquo; said Goldsmith,
      &ldquo;which is recommendation enough to Johnson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell mentioned another person of a very bad character, and wondered at
      Johnson&rsquo;s kindness to him. &ldquo;He is now become miserable,&rdquo;
      said Goldsmith, &ldquo;and that insures the protection of Johnson.&rdquo;
      Encomiums like these speak almost as much for the heart of him who praises
      as of him who is praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subsequently, when Boswell had become more intense in his literary
      idolatry, he affected to undervalue Goldsmith, and a lurking hostility to
      him is discernible throughout his writings, which some have attributed to
      a silly spirit of jealousy of the superior esteem evinced for the poet by
      Dr. Johnson. We have a gleam of this in his account of the first evening
      he spent in company with those two eminent authors at their famous resort,
      the Mitre Tavern, in Fleet Street. This took place on the 1st of July,
      1763. The trio supped together, and passed some time in literary
      conversation. On quitting the tavern, Johnson, who had now been sociably
      acquainted with Goldsmith for two years, and knew his merits, took him
      with him to drink tea with his blind pensioner, Miss Williams, a high
      privilege among his intimates and admirers. To Boswell, a recent
      acquaintance whose intrusive sycophancy had not yet made its way into his
      confidential intimacy, he gave no invitation. Boswell felt it with all the
      jealousy of a little mind. &ldquo;Dr. Goldsmith,&rdquo; says he, in his
      memoirs, &ldquo;being a privileged man, went with him, strutting away, and
      calling to me with an air of superiority, like that of an esoteric over an
      esoteric disciple of a sage of antiquity, &lsquo;I go to Miss Williams.&rsquo;
      I confess I then envied him this mighty privilege, of which he seemed to
      be so proud; but it was not long before I obtained the same mark of
      distinction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Obtained! but how? not like Goldsmith, by the force of unpretending but
      congenial merit, but by a course of the most pushing, contriving, and
      spaniel-like subserviency. Really, the ambition of the man to illustrate
      his mental insignificance, by continually placing himself in juxtaposition
      with the great lexicographer, has something in it perfectly ludicrous.
      Never, since the days of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, has there been
      presented to the world a more whimsically contrasted pair of associates
      than Johnson and Boswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Scotch cur at Johnson&rsquo;s heels?&rdquo; asked some
      one when Boswell had worked his way into incessant companionship. &ldquo;He
      is not a cur,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith, &ldquo;you are too severe; he is
      only a bur. Tom Davies flung him at Johnson in sport, and he has the
      faculty of sticking.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER FOURTEEN

    <p>
      HOGARTH A VISITOR AT ISLINGTON&mdash;HIS CHARACTER&mdash;STREET STUDIES&mdash;SYMPATHIES
      BETWEEN AUTHORS AND PAINTERS&mdash;SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS&mdash;HIS CHARACTER&mdash;HIS
      DINNERS&mdash;THE LITERARY CLUB-ITS MEMBERS&mdash;JOHNSON&rsquo;S REVELS
      WITH LANKEY AND BEAU&mdash;GOLDSMITH AT THE CLUB
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the intimates who used to visit the poet occasionally, in his
      retreat at Islington, was Hogarth the painter. Goldsmith had spoken well
      of him in his essays in the &ldquo;Public Ledger,&rdquo; and this formed
      the first link in their friendship. He was at this time upward of sixty
      years of age, and is described as a stout, active, bustling little man, in
      a sky-blue coat, satirical and dogmatic, yet full of real benevolence and
      the love of human nature. He was the moralist and philosopher of the
      pencil; like Goldsmith he had sounded the depths of vice and misery,
      without being polluted by them; and though his picturings had not the
      pervading amenity of those of the essayist, and dwelt more on the crimes
      and vices than the follies and humors of mankind, yet they were all
      calculated, in like manner, to fill the mind with instruction and precept,
      and to make the heart better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth does not appear to have had much of the rural feeling with which
      Goldsmith was so amply endowed, and may not have accompanied him in his
      strolls about hedges and green lanes; but he was a fit companion with whom
      to explore the mazes of London, in which he was continually on the lookout
      for character and incident. One of Hogarth&rsquo;s admirers speaks of
      having come upon him in Castle Street, engaged in one of his street
      studies, watching two boys who were quarreling; patting one on the back
      who flinched, and endeavoring to spirit him up to a fresh encounter.
      &ldquo;At him again! D&mdash;- him, if I would take it of him! at him
      again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A frail memorial of this intimacy between the painter and the poet exists
      in a portrait in oil, called &ldquo;Goldsmith&rsquo;s Hostess.&rdquo; It
      is supposed to have been painted by Hogarth in the course of his visits to
      Islington, and given by him to the poet as a means of paying his landlady.
      There are no friendships among men of talents more likely to be sincere
      than those between painters and poets. Possessed of the same qualities of
      mind, governed by the same principles of taste and natural laws of grace
      and beauty, but applying them to different yet mutually illustrative arts,
      they are constantly in sympathy and never in collision with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A still more congenial intimacy of the kind was that contracted by
      Goldsmith with Mr. afterward Sir Joshua Reynolds. The latter was now about
      forty years of age, a few years older than the poet, whom he charmed by
      the blandness and benignity of his manners, and the nobleness and
      generosity of his disposition, as much as he did by the graces of his
      pencil and the magic of his coloring. They were men of kindred genius,
      excelling in corresponding qualities of their several arts, for style in
      writing is what color is in painting; both are innate endowments, and
      equally magical hi their effects. Certain graces and harmonies of both may
      be acquired by diligent study and imitation, but only in a limited degree;
      whereas by their natural possessors they are exercised spontaneously,
      almost unconsciously, and with ever-varying fascination. Reynolds soon
      understood and appreciated the merits of Goldsmith, and a sincere and
      lasting friendship ensued between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Reynolds&rsquo; house Goldsmith mingled in a higher range of company
      than he had been accustomed to. The fame of this celebrated artist, and
      his amenity of manners, were gathering round him men of talents of all
      kinds, and the increasing affluence of his circumstances enabled him to
      give full indulgence to his hospitable disposition. Poor Goldsmith had not
      yet, like Dr. Johnson, acquired reputation enough to atone for his
      external defects and his want of the air of good society. Miss Reynolds
      used to inveigh against his personal appearance, which gave her the idea,
      she said, of a low mechanic, a journeyman tailor. One evening at a large
      supper party, being called upon to give as a toast the ugliest man she
      knew, she gave Dr. Goldsmith, upon which a lady who sat opposite, and whom
      she had never met before, shook hands with her across the table, and
      &ldquo;hoped to become better acquainted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a graphic and amusing picture of Reynolds&rsquo; hospitable but
      motley establishment, in an account given by a Mr. Courtenay to Sir James
      Mackintosh; though it speaks of a time after Reynolds had received the
      honor of knighthood. &ldquo;There was something singular,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;in the style and economy of Sir Joshua&rsquo;s table that
      contributed to pleasantry and good humor, a coarse, inelegant plenty,
      without any regard to order and arrangement. At five o&rsquo;clock
      precisely, dinner was served, whether all the invited guests were arrived
      or not. Sir Joshua was never so fashionably ill-bred as to wait an hour
      perhaps for two or three persons of rank or title, and put the rest of the
      company out of humor by this invidious distinction. His invitations,
      however, did not regulate the number of his guests. Many dropped in
      uninvited. A table prepared for seven or eight was of ten compelled to
      contain fifteen or sixteen. There was a consequent deficiency of knives,
      forks, plates, and glasses. The attendance was in the same style, and
      those who were knowing in the ways of the house took care on sitting down
      to call instantly for beer, bread, or wine, that they might secure a
      supply before the first course was over. He was once prevailed on to
      furnish the table with decanters and glasses at dinner, to save time and
      prevent confusion. These gradually were demolished in the course of
      service, and were never replaced. These trifling embarrassments, however,
      only served to enhance the hilarity and singular pleasure of the
      entertainment. The wine, cookery and dishes were but little attended to;
      nor was the fish or venison ever talked of or recommended. Amid this
      convivial animated bustle among his guests, our host sat perfectly
      composed; always attentive to what was said, never minding what was ate or
      drank, but left every one at perfect liberty to scramble for himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the casual but frequent meeting of men of talent at this hospitable
      board rose that association of wits, authors, scholars, and statesmen,
      renowned as the Literary Club. Reynolds was the first to propose a regular
      association of the kind, and was eagerly seconded by Johnson, who proposed
      as a model a club which he had formed many years previously in Ivy Lane,
      but which was now extinct. Like that club the number of members was
      limited to nine. They were to meet and sup together once a week, on Monday
      night, at the Turk&rsquo;s Head on Gerard Street, Soho, and two members
      were to constitute a meeting. It took a regular form hi the year 1764, but
      did not receive its literary appellation until several years afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original members were Reynolds, Johnson, Burke, Dr. Nugent, Bennet
      Langton, Topham Beauclerc, Chamier, Hawkins, and Goldsmith; and here a few
      words concerning some of the members may be acceptable. Burke was at that
      time about thirty-three years of age; he had mingled a little in politics,
      and been Under Secretary to Hamilton at Dublin, but was again a writer for
      the booksellers, and as yet but in the dawning of his fame. Dr. Nugent was
      his father-in-law, a Roman Catholic, and a physician of talent and
      instruction. Mr. afterward Sir John Hawkins was admitted into this
      association from having been a member of Johnson&rsquo;s Ivy Lane club.
      Originally an attorney, he had retired from the practice of the law, in
      consequence of a large fortune which fell to him in right of his wife, and
      was now a Middlesex magistrate. He was, moreover, a dabbler in literature
      and music, and was actually engaged on a history of music, which he
      subsequently published in five ponderous volumes. To him we are also
      indebted for a biography of Johnson, which appeared after the death of
      that eminent man. Hawkins was as mean and parsimonious as he was pompous
      and conceited. He forbore to partake of the suppers at the club, and
      begged therefore to be excused from paying his share of the reckoning.
      &ldquo;And was he excused?&rdquo; asked Dr. Burney of Johnson. &ldquo;Oh,
      yes, for no man is angry at another for being inferior to himself. We all
      scorned him and admitted his plea. Yet I really believe him to be an
      honest man at bottom, though to be sure he is penurious, and he is mean,
      and it must be owned he has a tendency to savageness.&rdquo; He did not
      remain above two or three years in the club; being in a manner elbowed out
      in consequence of his rudeness to Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Anthony Chamier was secretary in the War Office, and a friend of
      Beauclerc, by whom he was proposed. We have left our mention of Bennet
      Langton and Topham Beauclerc until the last, because we have most to say
      about them. They were doubtless induced to join the club through their
      devotion to Johnson, and the intimacy of these two very young and
      aristocratic young men with the stern and somewhat melancholy moralist is
      among the curiosities of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bennet Langton was of an ancient family, who held their ancestral estate
      of Langton in Lincolnshire, a great title to respect with Johnson. &ldquo;Langton,
      sir,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;has a grant of free warrant from Henry
      the Second; and Cardinal Stephen Langton, in King John&rsquo;s reign, was
      of this family.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Langton was of a mild, contemplative, enthusiastic nature. When but
      eighteen years of age he was so delighted with reading Johnson&rsquo;s
      Rambler that he came to London chiefly with a view to obtain an
      introduction to the author. Boswell gives us an account of his first
      interview, which took place in the morning. It is not often that the
      personal appearance of an author agrees with the preconceived ideas of his
      admirer. Langton, from perusing the writings of Johnson, expected to find
      him a decent, well dressed, in short a remarkably decorous philosopher.
      Instead of which, down from his bed chamber about noon, came, as newly
      risen, a large uncouth figure, with a little dark wig which scarcely
      covered his head, and his clothes hanging loose about him. But his
      conversation was so rich, so animated, and so forcible, and his religious
      and political notions so congenial with those in which Langton had been
      educated, that he conceived for him that veneration and attachment which
      he ever preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Langton went to pursue his studies at Trinity College, Oxford, where
      Johnson saw much of him during a visit which he paid to the university. He
      found him in close intimacy with Topham Beauclerc, a youth two years older
      than himself, very gay and dissipated, and wondered what sympathies could
      draw two young men together of such opposite characters. On becoming
      acquainted with Beauclerc he found that, rake though he was, he possessed
      an ardent love of literature, an acute understanding, polished wit, innate
      gentility and high aristocratic breeding. He was, moreover, the only son
      of Lord Sidney Beauclerc and grandson of the Duke of St. Albans, and was
      thought in some particulars to have a resemblance to Charles the Second.
      These were high recommendations with Johnson, and when the youth testified
      a profound respect for him and an ardent admiration of his talents the
      conquest was complete, so that in a &ldquo;short time,&rdquo; says
      Boswell, &ldquo;the moral pious Johnson and the gay dissipated Beauclerc
      were companions.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The intimacy begun in college chambers was continued when the youth came
      to town during the vacations. The uncouth, unwieldy moralist was flattered
      at finding himself an object of idolatry to two high-born, high-bred,
      aristocratic young men, and throwing gravity aside, was ready to join in
      their vagaries and play the part of a &ldquo;young man upon town.&rdquo;
      Such at least is the picture given of him by Boswell on one occasion when
      Beauclerc and Langton having supped together at a tavern determined to
      give Johnson a rouse at three o&rsquo;clock in the morning. They
      accordingly rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple.
      The indignant sage sallied forth in his shirt, poker in hand, and a little
      black wig on the top of his head, instead of helmet; prepared to wreak
      vengeance on the assailants of his castle; but when his two young friends,
      Lankey and Beau, as he used to call them, presented themselves, summoning
      him forth to a morning ramble, his whole manner changed. &ldquo;What, is
      it you, ye dogs?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll have a frisk
      with you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So said so done. They sallied forth together into Covent Garden; figured
      among the green grocers and fruit women, just come in from the country
      with their hampers; repaired to a neighboring tavern, where Johnson brewed
      a bowl of <i>bishop</i>, a favorite beverage with him, grew merry over his
      cups, and anathematized sleep in two lines from Lord Lansdowne&rsquo;s
      drinking song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Short, very short, be then thy reign,
  For I&rsquo;m in haste to laugh and drink again.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They then took boat again, rowed to Billingsgate, and Johnson and
      Beauclerc determined, like &ldquo;mad wags,&rdquo; to &ldquo;keep it up&rdquo;
      for the rest of the day. Langton, however, the most sober-minded of the
      three, pleaded an engagement to breakfast with some young ladies;
      whereupon the great moralist reproached him with &ldquo;leaving his social
      friends to go and sit with a set of wretched <i>unideal</i> girls.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This madcap freak of the great lexicographer made a sensation, as may well
      be supposed, among his intimates. &ldquo;I heard of your frolic t&rsquo;other
      night,&rdquo; said Garrick to him; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be in the &lsquo;Chronicle.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      He uttered worse forebodings to others. &ldquo;I shall have my old friend
      to bail out of the round-house,&rdquo; said he. Johnson, however, valued
      himself upon having thus enacted a chapter in the Rake&rsquo;s Progress,
      and crowed over Garrick on the occasion. &ldquo;<i>He</i> durst not do
      such a thing!&rdquo; chuckled he, &ldquo;his <i>wife</i> would not <i>let</i>
      him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When these two young men entered the club, Langton was about twenty-two,
      and Beauclerc about twenty-four years of age, and both were launched on
      London life. Langton, however, was still the mild, enthusiastic scholar,
      steeped to the lips in Greek, with fine conversational powers and an
      invaluable talent for listening. He was upward of six feet high, and very
      spare. &ldquo;Oh! that we could sketch him,&rdquo; exclaims Miss Hawkins,
      in her Memoirs, &ldquo;with his mild countenance, his elegant features,
      and his sweet smile, sitting with one leg twisted round the other, as if
      fearing to occupy more space than was equitable; his person inclining
      forward, as if wanting strength to support his weight, and his arms
      crossed over his bosom, or his hands locked together on his knee.&rdquo;
      Beauclerc, on such occasions, sportively compared him to a stork in
      Raphael&rsquo;s Cartoons, standing on one leg. Beauclerc was more &ldquo;a
      man upon town,&rdquo; a lounger in St. James&rsquo;s Street, an associate
      with George Selwyn, with Walpole, and other aristocratic wits; a man of
      fashion at court; a casual frequenter of the gaming-table; yet, with all
      this, he alternated in the easiest and happiest manner the scholar and the
      man of letters; lounged into the club with the most perfect
      self-possession, bringing with him the careless grace and polished wit of
      high-bred society, but making himself cordially at home among his learned
      fellow members.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gay yet lettered rake maintained his sway over Johnson, who was
      fascinated by that air of the world, that ineffable tone of good society
      in which he felt himself deficient, especially as the possessor of it
      always paid homage to his superior talent. &ldquo;Beauclerc,&rdquo; he
      would say, using a quotation from Pope, &ldquo;has a love of folly, but a
      scorn of fools; everything he does shows the one, and everything he says
      the other.&rdquo; Beauclerc delighted in rallying the stern moralist of
      whom others stood in awe, and no one, according to Boswell, could take
      equal liberty with him with impunity. Johnson, it is well known, was often
      shabby and negligent in his dress, and not overcleanly in his person. On
      receiving a pension from the crown, his friends vied with each other in
      respectful congratulations. Beauclerc simply scanned his person with a
      whimsical glance, and hoped that, like Falstaff, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d in
      future purge and live cleanly like a gentleman.&rdquo; Johnson took the
      hint with unexpected good humor, and profited by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Beauclerc&rsquo;s satirical vein, which darted shafts on every side,
      was not always tolerated by Johnson. &lsquo;&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he on
      one occasion, &ldquo;you never open your mouth but with intention to give
      pain; and you have often given me pain, not from the power of what you
      have said, but from seeing your intention.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was at first proposed to enroll Goldsmith among the members of
      this association, there seems to have been some demur; at least so says
      the pompous Hawkins. &ldquo;As he wrote for the booksellers, we of the
      club looked on him as a mere literary drudge, equal to the task of
      compiling and translating, but little capable of original and still less
      of poetical composition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even for some time after his admission, he continued to be regarded in a
      dubious light by some of the members. Johnson and Reynolds, of course,
      were well aware of his merits, nor was Burke a stranger to them; but to
      the others he was as yet a sealed book, and the outside was not
      prepossessing. His ungainly person and awkward manners were against him
      with men accustomed to the graces of society, and he was not sufficiently
      at home to give play to his humor and to that bonhomie which won the
      hearts of all who knew him. He felt strange and out of place in this new
      sphere; he felt at times the cool satirical eye of the courtly Beauclerc
      scanning him, and the more he attempted to appear at his ease the more
      awkward he became.

      JOHNSON A MONITOR TO GOLDSMITH&mdash;FINDS HIM IN DISTRESS WITH HIS

      OF THE TRAVELER&mdash;THE POET AND HIS DOG&mdash;SUCCESS OF THE POEM&mdash;ASTONISHMENT

    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson had now become one of Goldsmith&rsquo;s best friends and advisers.
      He knew all the weak points of his character, but he knew also his merits;
      and while he would rebuke him like a child, and rail at his errors and
      follies, he would suffer no one else to undervalue him. Goldsmith knew the
      soundness of his judgment and his practical benevolence, and often sought
      his counsel and aid amid the difficulties into which his heedlessness was
      continually plunging him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received one morning,&rdquo; says Johnson, &ldquo;a message from
      poor Goldsmith that he was in great distress, and, as it was not in his
      power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as soon as possible.
      I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him directly. I accordingly
      went as soon as I was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested
      him for his rent, at which he was in a violent passion: I perceived that
      he had already changed my guinea, and had a bottle of Madeira and a glass
      before him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and
      began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then
      told me he had a novel ready for the press, which he produced to me. I
      looked into it and saw its merit; told the landlady I should soon return;
      and, having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty pounds. I brought
      Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his rent, not without rating his
      landlady in a high tone for having used him go ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The novel in question was the Vicar of Wakefield; the bookseller to whom
      Johnson sold it was Francis Newbery, nephew to John. Strange as it may
      seem, this captivating work, which has obtained and preserved an almost
      unrivaled popularity in various languages, was so little appreciated by
      the bookseller that he kept it by him for nearly two years unpublished!
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith had, as yet, produced nothing of moment in poetry. Among his
      literary jobs, it is true, was an oratorio entitled The Captivity, founded
      on the bondage of the Israelites in Babylon. It was one of those unhappy
      offsprings of the muse ushered into existence amid the distortions of
      music. Most of the oratorio has passed into oblivion; but the following
      song from it will never die:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;The wretch condemned from life to part,
    Still, still on hope relies,
  And every pang that rends the heart
    Bids expectation rise.

 &ldquo;Hope, like the glimmering taper&rsquo;s light,
    Illumes and cheers our way;
  And still, as darker grows the night,
    Emits a brighter ray.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Goldsmith distrusted his qualifications to succeed in poetry, and doubted
      the disposition of the public mind in regard to it. &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;I have come too late into the world; Pope and other poets
      have taken up the places in the temple of Fame; and as few at any period
      can possess poetical reputation, a man of genius can now hardly acquire
      it.&rdquo; Again, on another occasion, he observes: &ldquo;Of all kinds of
      ambition, as things are now circumstanced, perhaps that which pursues
      poetical fame is the wildest. What from the increased refinement of the
      tunes, from the diversity of judgment produced by opposing systems of
      criticism, and from the more prevalent divisions of opinion influenced by
      party, the strongest and happiest efforts can expect to please but in a
      very narrow circle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this very time he had by him his poem of The Traveler. The plan of it,
      as has already been observed, was conceived many years before, during his
      travels in Switzerland, and a sketch of it sent from that country to his
      brother Henry in Ireland. The original outline is said to have embraced a
      wider scope; but it was probably contracted through diffidence, in the
      process of finishing the parts. It had laid by him for several years in a
      crude state, and it was with extreme hesitation and after much revision
      that he at length submitted it to Dr. Johnson. The frank and warm
      approbation of the latter encouraged him to finish it for the press; and
      Dr. Johnson himself contributed a few lines toward the conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hear much about &ldquo;poetic inspiration,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;poet&rsquo;s
      eye in a fine frenzy rolling&rdquo;; but Sir Joshua Reynolds gives an
      anecdote of Goldsmith while engaged upon his poem, calculated to cure our
      notions about the ardor of composition. Calling upon the poet one day, he
      opened the door without ceremony, and found him in the double occupation
      of turning a couplet and teaching a pet dog to sit upon his haunches. At
      one time he would glance his eye at his desk, and at another shake his
      finger at the dog to make him retain his position. The last lines on the
      page were still wet; they form a part of the description of Italy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;By sports like these are all their cares beguiled,
  The sports of children satisfy the child.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Goldsmith, with his usual good-humor, joined in the laugh caused by his
      whimsical employment, and acknowledged that his boyish sport with the dog
      suggested the stanza The poem was published on the 19th of December, 1764,
      in a quarto form, by Newbery, and was the first of his works to which
      Goldsmith prefixed his name. As a testimony of cherished and well-merited
      affection, he dedicated it to his brother Henry. There is an amusing
      affectation of indifference as to its fate expressed in the dedication.
      &ldquo;What reception a poem may find,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;which has
      neither abuse, party, nor blank verse to support it, I cannot tell, nor am
      I solicitous to know.&rdquo; The truth is, no one was more emulous and
      anxious for poetic fame; and never was he more anxious than in the present
      instance, for it was his grand stake. Dr. Johnson aided the launching of
      the poem by a favorable notice in the &ldquo;Critical Review&rdquo;; other
      periodical works came out in its favor. Some of the author&rsquo;s friends
      complained that it did not command instant and wide popularity; that it
      was a poem to win, not to strike; it went on rapidly increasing in favor;
      in three months a second edition was issued; shortly afterward a third;
      then a fourth; and, before the year was out, the author was pronounced the
      best poet of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of The Traveler at once altered Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      intellectual standing in the estimation of society; but its effect upon
      the club, if we may judge from the account given by Hawkins, was most
      ludicrous. They were lost in astonishment that a &ldquo;newspaper essayist&rdquo;
      and &ldquo;bookseller&rsquo;s, drudge&rdquo; should have written such a
      poem. On the evening of its announcement to them Goldsmith had gone away
      early, after &ldquo;rattling away as usual,&rdquo; and they knew not how
      to reconcile his heedless garrulity with the serene beauty, the easy
      grace, the sound good sense, and the occasional elevation of his poetry.
      They could scarcely believe that such magic numbers had flowed from a man
      to whom in general, says Johnson, &ldquo;it was with difficulty they could
      give a hearing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, exclaimed Chamier, &ldquo;I do
      believe he wrote this poem himself, and, let me tell you, that is
      believing a great deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next meeting of the club Chamier sounded the author a little about
      his poem. &ldquo;Mr. Goldsmith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what do you mean by
      the last word in the first line of your Traveler, &lsquo;remote,
      unfriended, solitary, slow?&rsquo; do you mean tardiness of locomotion?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith inconsiderately, being probably
      flurried at the moment. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; interposed his protecting
      friend Johnson, &ldquo;you did not mean tardiness of locomotion; you meant
      that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed Goldsmith, &ldquo;that was what I meant.&rdquo;
      Chamier immediately believed that Johnson himself had written the line,
      and a rumor became prevalent that he was the author of many of the finest
      passages. This was ultimately set at rest by Johnson himself, who marked
      with a pencil all the verses he had contributed, nine in number, inserted
      toward the conclusion, and by no means the best in the poem. He moreover,
      with generous warmth, pronounced it the finest poem that had appeared
      since the days of Pope.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one of the highest testimonials to the charm of the poem was given by
      Miss Reynolds, who had toasted poor Goldsmith as the ugliest man of her
      acquaintance. Shortly after the appearance of The Traveler, Dr. Johnson
      read it aloud from beginning to end in her presence. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
      exclaimed she, when he had finished, &ldquo;I never more shall think Dr.
      Goldsmith ugly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion, when the merits of The Traveler were discussed at
      Reynolds&rsquo; board, Langton declared &ldquo;There was not a bad line in
      the poem, not one of Dryden&rsquo;s careless verses.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was
      glad,&rdquo; observed Reynolds, &ldquo;to hear Charles Fox say it was one
      of the finest poems in the English language.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why was you
      glad?&rdquo; rejoined Langton; &ldquo;you surely had no doubt of this
      before.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; interposed Johnson, decisively; &ldquo;the
      merit of The Traveler is so well established that Mr. Fox&rsquo;s praise
      cannot augment it, nor his censure diminish it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell, who was absent from England at the time of the publication of The
      Traveler, was astonished, on his return, to find Goldsmith, whom he had so
      much undervalued, suddenly elevated almost to a par with his idol. He
      accounted for it by concluding that much both of the sentiments and
      expression of the poem had been derived from conversations with Johnson.
      &ldquo;He imitates you, sir,&rdquo; said this incarnation of toadyism.
      &ldquo;Why, no, sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;Jack Hawksworth is one
      of my imitators, but not Goldsmith. Goldy, sir, has great merit.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;But, sir, he is much indebted to you for his getting so high in the
      public estimation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sir, he has, perhaps, got <i>sooner
      to it by his intimacy with me.&rdquo; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The poem went through several editions in the course of the first year,
      and received some few additions and corrections from the author&rsquo;s
      pen. It produced a golden harvest to Mr. Newbery, but all the remuneration
      on record, doled out by his niggard hand to the author, was twenty
      guineas!

      Goldsmith, now that he was rising in the world, and becoming a notoriety,
      felt himself called upon to improve his style of living. He according
      emerged from Wine-Office Court, and took chambers in the Temple. It is
      true they were but of humble pretensions, situated on what was then the
      library staircase, and it would appear that he was a kind of inmate with
      Jeffs, the butler of the society. Still he was in the Temple, that classic
      region rendered famous by the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; and other essayists,
      as the abode of gay wits and thoughtful men of letters; and which, with
      its retired courts and embowered gardens, in the very heart of a noisy
      metropolis, is, to the quiet-seeking student and author, an oasis
      freshening with verdure in the midst of a desert. Johnson, who had become
      a kind of growling supervisor of the poet&rsquo;s affairs, paid him a
      visit soon after he had installed himself in his new quarters, and went
      prying about the apartment, in his near-sighted manner, examining
      everything minutely. Goldsmith was fidgeted by this curious scrutiny, and
      apprehending a disposition to find fault, exclaimed, with the air of a man
      who had money in both pockets, &ldquo;I shall soon be in better chambers
      than these.&rdquo; The harmless bravado drew a reply from Johnson which
      touched the chord of proper pride. &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;never mind that. Nil te quæsiveris extra,&rdquo; implying that his
      reputation rendered him independent of outward show. Happy would it have
      been for poor Goldsmith could he have kept this consolatory compliment
      perpetually in mind, and squared his expenses accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the persons of rank who were struck with the merits of The Traveler
      was the Earl (afterward Duke) of Northumberland. He procured several other
      of Goldsmith&rsquo;s writings, the perusal of which tended to elevate the
      author in his good opinion, and to gain for him his good will. The earl
      held the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and understanding Goldsmith
      was an Irishman, was disposed to extend to him the patronage which his
      high post afforded. He intimated the same to his relative, Dr. Percy, who,
      he found, was well acquainted with the poet, and expressed a wish that the
      latter should wait upon him. Here, then, was another opportunity for
      Goldsmith to better his fortune, had he been knowing and worldly enough to
      profit by it. Unluckily the path to fortune lay through the aristocratical
      mazes of Northumberland House, and the poet blundered at the outset. The
      following is the account he used to give of his visit: &ldquo;I dressed
      myself in the best manner I could, and, after studying some compliments I
      thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to Northumberland House,
      and acquainted the servants that I had particular business with the duke.
      They showed me into an antechamber, where, after waiting some time, a
      gentleman, very elegantly dressed, made his appearance; taking him for the
      duke, I delivered all the fine things I had composed in order to
      compliment him on the honor he had done me; when, to my great
      astonishment, he told me I had mistaken him for his master, who would see
      me immediately. At that instant the duke came into the apartment, and I
      was so confounded on the occasion that I wanted words barely sufficient to
      express the sense I entertained of the duke&rsquo;s politeness, and went
      away exceedingly chagrined at the blunder I had committed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir John Hawkins, in his life of Dr. Johnson, gives some further
      particulars of this visit, of which he was, in part, a witness. &ldquo;Having
      one day,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a call to make on the late Duke, then
      Earl, of Northumberland, I found Goldsmith waiting for an audience in an
      outer room; I asked him what had brought him there; he told me an
      invitation from his lordship. I made my business as short as I could, and,
      as a reason, mentioned that Dr. Goldsmith was waiting without. The earl
      asked me if I was acquainted with him. I told him that I was, adding what
      I thought was most likely to recommend him. I retired, and stayed in the
      outer room to take him home. Upon his coming out, I asked him the result
      of his conversation. &lsquo;His lordship,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;told me
      he had read my poem, meaning The Traveler, and was much delighted with it;
      that he was going to be lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and that, hearing I
      was a native of that country, he should be glad to do me any kindness.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;And what did you answer,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to this gracious
      offer?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I could say nothing but
      that I had a brother there, a clergyman, that stood in need of help: as
      for myself, I have no great dependence on the promises of great men; I
      look to the booksellers for support; they are my best friends, and I am
      not inclined to forsake them for others.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo;
      continues Sir John, &ldquo;did this idiot in the affairs of the world
      trifle with his fortunes, and put back the hand that was held out to
      assist him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot join with Sir John in his worldly sneer at the conduct of
      Goldsmith on this occasion. While we admire that honest independence of
      spirit which prevented him from asking favors for himself, we love that
      warmth of affection which instantly sought to advance the fortunes of a
      brother: but the peculiar merits of poor Goldsmith seem to have been
      little understood by the Hawkinses, the Boswells, and the other
      biographers of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, the introduction to Northumberland House did not prove so
      complete a failure as the humorous account given by Goldsmith, and the
      cynical account given by Sir John Hawkins, might lead one to suppose. Dr.
      Percy, the heir male of the ancient Percies, brought the poet into the
      acquaintance of his kinswoman, the countess, who, before her marriage with
      the earl, was in her own right heiress of the House of Northumberland.
      &ldquo;She was a lady,&rdquo; says Boswell, &ldquo;not only of high
      dignity of spirit, such as became her noble blood, but of excellent
      understanding and lively talents.&rdquo; Under her auspices a poem of
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s had an aristocratical introduction to the world. This
      was the beautiful ballad of the Hermit, originally published under the
      name of Edwin and Angelina. It was suggested by an old English ballad
      beginning &ldquo;Gentle Herdsman,&rdquo; shown him by Dr. Percy, who was
      at that time making his famous collection, entitled Reliques of Ancient
      English Poetry, which he submitted to the inspection of Goldsmith prior to
      publication. A few copies only of the Hermit were printed at first, with
      the following title page: &ldquo;Edwin and Angelina: a Ballad. By Mr.
      Goldsmith. Printed for the Amusement of the Countess of Northumberland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, though it may not have been attended with any immediate
      pecuniary advantage, contributed to give Goldsmith&rsquo;s name and poetry
      the high stamp of fashion, so potent in England; the circle at
      Northumberland House, however, was of too stately and aristocratical a
      nature to be much to his taste, and we do not find that he became familiar
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was much more at home at Gosford, the noble seat of his countryman,
      Robert Nugent, afterward Baron Nugent and Viscount Clare, who appreciated
      his merits even more heartily than the Earl of Northumberland, and
      occasionally made him his guest both in town and country. Nugent is
      described as a jovial voluptuary, who left the Roman Catholic for the
      Protestant religion, with a view to bettering his fortunes; he had an
      Irishman&rsquo;s inclination for rich widows, and an Irishman&rsquo;s luck
      with the sex; having been thrice married and gained a fortune with each
      wife. He was now nearly sixty, with a remarkably loud voice, broad Irish
      brogue, and ready, but somewhat coarse wit. With all his occasional
      coarseness he was capable of high thought, and had produced poems which
      showed a truly poetic vein. He was long a member of the House of Commons,
      where his ready wit, his fearless decision, and good-humored audacity of
      expression, always gained him a hearing, though his tall person and
      awkward manner gained him the nickname of Squire Gawky, among the
      political scribblers of the day. With a patron of this jovial temperament
      Goldsmith probably felt more at ease than with those of higher refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The celebrity which Goldsmith had acquired by his poem of The Traveler,
      occasioned a resuscitation of many of his miscellaneous and anonymous
      tales and essays from the various newspapers and other transient
      publications in which they lay dormant. These he published in 1765, in a
      collected form, under the title of &ldquo;Essays by Mr. Goldsmith.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;The following essays,&rdquo; observes he in his preface, &ldquo;have
      already appeared at different times, and in different publications. The
      pamphlets in which they were inserted being generally unsuccessful, these
      shared the common fate, without assisting the booksellers&rsquo; aims, or
      extending the author&rsquo;s reputation. The public were too strenuously
      employed with their own follies to be assiduous in estimating mine; so
      that many of my best attempts in this way have fallen victims to the
      transient topic of the times&mdash;the Ghost in Cock Lane, or the Siege of
      Ticonderoga.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, though they have passed pretty silently into the world, I can
      by no means complain of their circulation. The magazines and papers of the
      day have indeed been liberal enough in this respect. Most of these essays
      have been regularly reprinted twice or thrice a year, and conveyed to the
      public through the kennel of some engaging compilation. If there be a
      pride in multiplied editions, I have seen some of my labors sixteen times
      reprinted, and claimed by different parents as their own. I have seen them
      flourished at the beginning with praise, and signed at the end with the
      names of Philautos, Philalethes, Phileleutheros, and Philanthropos. It is
      time, however, at last to vindicate my claims; and as these entertainers
      of the public, as they call themselves, have partly lived upon me for some
      years, let me now try if I cannot live a little upon myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but little, in fact, for all the pecuniary emolument he received
      from the volume was twenty guineas. It had a good circulation, however,
      was translated into French, and has maintained its stand among the British
      classics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding that the reputation of Goldsmith had greatly risen, his
      finances were often at a very low ebb, owing to his heedlessness as to
      expense, his liability to be imposed upon, and a spontaneous and
      irresistible propensity to give to every one who asked. The very rise in
      his reputation had increased these embarrassments. It had enlarged his
      circle of needy acquaintances, authors poorer in pocket than himself, who
      came in search of literary counsel; which generally meant a guinea and a
      breakfast. And then his Irish hangers-on! &ldquo;Our doctor,&rdquo; said
      one of these sponges, &ldquo;had a constant levee of his distressed
      countrymen, whose wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved; and he
      has often been known to leave himself without a guinea, in order to supply
      the necessities of others.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This constant drainage of the purse therefore obliged him to undertake all
      jobs proposed by the booksellers, and to keep up a kind of running account
      with Mr. Newbery; who was his banker on all occasions, sometimes for
      pounds, sometimes for shillings; but who was a rigid accountant, and took
      care to be amply repaid in manuscript. Many effusions, hastily penned in
      these moments of exigency, were published anonymously, and never claimed.
      Some of them have but recently been traced to his pen; while of many the
      true authorship will probably never be discovered. Among others it is
      suggested, and with great probability, that he wrote for Mr. Newbery the
      famous nursery story of Goody Two Shoes, which appeared in 1765, at a
      moment when Goldsmith was scribbling for Newbery, and much pressed for
      funds. Several quaint little tales introduced in his Essays show that he
      had a turn for this species of mock history; and the advertisement and
      title-page bear the stamp of his sly and playful humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are desired to give notice that there is in the press, and
      speedily will be published, either by subscription or otherwise, as the
      public shall please to determine, the History of Little Goody Two Shoes,
      otherwise Mrs. Margery Two Shoes; with the means by which she acquired
      learning and wisdom, and, in consequence thereof, her estate; set forth at
      large for the benefit of those
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Who, from a state of rags and care,
  And having shoes but half a pair,
  Their fortune and their fame should fix,
  And gallop in a coach and six.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The world is probably not aware of the ingenuity, humor, good sense, and
      sly satire contained in many of the old English nursery-tales. They have
      evidently been the sportive productions of able writers, who would not
      trust their names to productions that might be considered beneath their
      dignity. The ponderous works on which they relied for immortality have
      perhaps sunk into oblivion, and carried their names down with them; while
      their unacknowledged offspring, Jack the Giant Killer, Giles Gingerbread,
      and Tom Thumb, flourish in wide-spreading and never-ceasing popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Goldsmith had now acquired popularity and an extensive acquaintance, he
      attempted, with the advice of his friends, to procure a more regular and
      ample support by resuming the medical profession. He accordingly launched
      himself upon the town in style; hired a man-servant; replenished his
      wardrobe at considerable expense, and appeared in a professional wig and
      cane, purple silk small-clothes, and a scarlet roquelaure buttoned to the
      chin: a fantastic garb, as we should think at the present day, but not
      unsuited to the fashion of the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his sturdy little person thus arrayed in the unusual magnificence of
      purple and fine linen, and his scarlet roquelaure flaunting from his
      shoulders, he used to strut into the apartments of his patients swaying
      his three-cornered hat in one hand and his medical scepter, the cane, in
      the other, and assuming an air of gravity and importance suited to the
      solemnity of his wig; at least, such is the picture given of him by the
      waiting gentlewoman who let him into the chamber of one of his lady
      patients.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon, however, grew tired and impatient of the duties and restraints of
      his profession; his practice was chiefly among his friends, and the fees
      were not sufficient for his maintenance; he was disgusted with attendance
      on sick-chambers and capricious patients, and looked back with longing to
      his tavern haunts and broad convivial meetings, from which the dignity and
      duties of his medical calling restrained him. At length, on prescribing to
      a lady of his acquaintance who, to use a hackneyed phrase, &ldquo;rejoiced&rdquo;
      in the aristocratical name of Sidebotham, a warm dispute arose between him
      and the apothecary as to the quantity of medicine to be administered. The
      doctor stood up for the rights and dignities of his profession, and
      resented the interference of the compounder of drugs. His rights and
      dignities, however, were disregarded; his wig and cane and scarlet
      roquelaure were of no avail; Mrs. Sidebotham sided with the hero of the
      pestle and mortar; and Goldsmith flung out of the house in a passion.
      &ldquo;I am determined henceforth,&rdquo; said he to Topham Beauclerc,
      &ldquo;to leave off prescribing for friends.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do so, my dear
      doctor,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;whenever you undertake to kill, let
      it be only your enemies.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the end of Goldsmith&rsquo;s medical career.

      CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      PUBLICATION OF THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD&mdash;OPINIONS CONCERNING IT&mdash;OF
      DR. JOHNSON&mdash;OF ROGERS THE POET&mdash;OF GOETHE&mdash;ITS MERITS&mdash;EXQUISITE
      EXTRACT&mdash;ATTACK BY KENRICK&mdash;REPLY&mdash;BOOK-BUILDING&mdash;PROJECT
      OF A COMEDY
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the poem of The Traveler, and the popularity which it had
      conferred on its author, now roused the attention of the bookseller in
      whose hands the novel of The Vicar of Wakefield had been slumbering for
      nearly two long years. The idea has generally prevailed that it was Mr.
      John Newbery to whom the manuscript had been sold, and much surprise has
      been expressed that he should be insensible to its merit and suffer it to
      remain unpublished, while putting forth various inferior writings by the
      same author. This, however, is a mistake; it was his nephew, Francis
      Newbery, who had become the fortunate purchaser. Still the delay is
      equally unaccountable. Some have imagined that the uncle and nephew had
      business arrangements together, in which this work was included, and that
      the elder Newbery, dubious of its success, retarded the publication until
      the full harvest of The Traveler should be reaped. Booksellers are prone
      to make egregious mistakes as to the merit of works in manuscript; and to
      undervalue, if not reject, those of classic and enduring excellence, when
      destitute of that false brilliancy commonly called &ldquo;effect.&rdquo;
      In the present instance, an intellect vastly superior to that of either of
      the booksellers was equally at fault. Dr. Johnson, speaking of the work to
      Boswell, some time subsequent to its publication, observed, &ldquo;I
      myself did not think it would have had much success. It was written and
      sold to a bookseller before The Traveler, but published after, so little
      expectation had the bookseller from it. Had it been sold after The
      Traveler, he might have had twice as much money; though sixty guineas was
      no mean price<i>.&rdquo; </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixty guineas for the Vicar of Wakefield! and this could be pronounced no
      mean<i> price by Dr. Johnson, at that time the arbiter of British talent,
      and who had had an opportunity of witnessing the effect of the work upon
      the public mind; for its success was immediate. It came out on the 27th of
      March, 1766; before the end of May a second edition was called for; in
      three months more a third; and so it went on, widening in a popularity
      that has never flagged. Rogers, the Nestor of British literature, whose
      refined purity of taste and exquisite mental organization rendered him
      eminently calculated to appreciate a work of the kind, declared that of
      all the books which, through the fitful changes of three generations, he
      had seen rise and fall, the charm of the Vicar of Wakefield had alone
      continued as at first; and could he revisit the world after an interval of
      many more generations, he should as surely look to find it undiminished.
      Nor has its celebrity been confined to Great Britain. Though so
      exclusively a picture of British scenes and manners, it has been
      translated into almost every language, and everywhere its charm has been
      the same. Goethe, the great genius of Germany, declared in his
      eighty-first year that it was his delight at the age of twenty, that it
      had in a manner formed a part of his education, influencing his taste and
      feelings throughout life, and that he had recently read it again from
      beginning to end&mdash;with renewed delight, and with a grateful sense of
      the early benefit derived from it. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to expatiate upon the qualities of a work which has thus
      passed from country to country, and language to language, until it is now
      known throughout the whole reading world, and is become a household book
      in every hand. The secret of its universal and enduring popularity is
      undoubtedly its truth to nature, but to nature of the most amiable kind;
      to nature such as Goldsmith saw it. The author, as we have occasionally
      shown in the course of this memoir, took his scenes and characters in this
      as in his other writings, from originals in his own motley experience; but
      he has given them as seen through the medium of his own indulgent eye, and
      has set them forth with the colorings of his own good head and heart. Yet
      how contradictory it seems that this, one of the most delightful pictures
      of home and homefelt happiness, should be drawn by a homeless man; that
      the most amiable picture of domestic virtue and all the endearments of the
      married state should be drawn by a bachelor, who had been severed from
      domestic life almost from boyhood; that one of the most tender, touching,
      and affecting appeals on behalf of female loveliness should have been made
      by a man whose deficiency in all the graces of person and manner seemed to
      mark him out for a cynical disparager of the sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot refrain from transcribing from the work a short passage
      illustrative of what we have said, and which within a wonderfully small
      compass comprises a world of beauty of imagery, tenderness of feeling,
      delicacy and refinement of thought, and matchless purity of style. The two
      stanzas which conclude it, in which are told a whole history of woman&rsquo;s
      wrongs and sufferings, is, for pathos, simplicity, and euphony, a gem in
      the language. The scene depicted is where the poor Vicar is gathering
      around him the wrecks of his shattered family, and endeavoring to rally
      them back to happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next morning the sun arose with peculiar warmth for the season,
      so that we agreed to breakfast together on the honeysuckle bank; where,
      while we sat, my youngest daughter at my request joined her voice to the
      concert on the trees about us. It was in this place my poor Olivia first
      met her seducer, and every object served to recall her sadness. But that
      melancholy which is excited by objects of pleasure, or inspired by sounds
      of harmony, soothes the heart instead of corroding it. Her mother, too,
      upon this occasion, felt a pleasing distress, and wept, and loved her
      daughter as before. &lsquo;Do, my pretty Olivia,&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;let
      us have that melancholy air your father was so fond of; your sister Sophy
      has already obliged us. Do, child; it will please your old father.&rsquo;
      She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic as moved me.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;When lovely woman stoops to folly,
  And finds too late that men betray,
  What charm can soothe her melancholy.
  What art can wash her guilt away?

  &ldquo;&lsquo;The only art her guilt to cover,
  To hide her shame from every eye,
  To give repentance to her lover,
  And wring his bosom&mdash;is to die.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Scarce had the Vicar of Wakefield made its appearance and been received
      with acclamation than its author was subjected to one of the usual
      penalties that attend success. He was attacked in the newspapers. In one
      of the chapters he had introduced his ballad of the Hermit, of which, as
      we have mentioned, a few copies had been printed some considerable time
      previously for the use of the Countess of Northumberland. This brought
      forth the following article in a fashionable journal of the day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Printer of the &lsquo;St. James&rsquo;s Chronicle<i>.&rsquo;
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;In the Reliques of Ancient Poetry, published about two
      years ago, is a very beautiful little balled called A Friar of Orders
      Gray. The ingenious editor, Mr. Percy, supposes that the stanzas sung by
      Ophelia in the play of Hamlet were parts of some ballad well known in
      Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, and from these stanzas with the addition of one
      or two of his own to connect them, he has formed the above-mentioned
      ballad; the subject of which is, a lady comes to a convent to inquire for
      her love who had been driven there by her disdain. She is answered by a
      friar that he is dead:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;No, no, he is dead, gone to his death&rsquo;s bed.
  He never will come again.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady weeps and laments her cruelty; the friar endeavors to
      comfort her with morality and religion, but all in vain; she expresses the
      deepest grief and the most tender sentiments of love, till at last the
      friar discovers himself:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;And lo! beneath this gown of gray
  Thy own true love appears.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This catastrophe is very fine, and the whole, joined with the
      greatest tenderness, has the greatest simplicity; yet, though this ballad
      was so recently published in the Ancient Reliques, Dr. Goldsmith has been
      hardy enough to publish a poem called The Hermit, where the circumstances
      and catastrophe are exactly the same, only with this difference, that the
      natural simplicity and tenderness of the original are almost entirely lost
      in the languid smoothness and tedious paraphrase of the copy, which is as
      short of the merits of Mr. Percy&rsquo;s ballad as the insipidity of negus
      is to the genuine flavor of champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir, yours, etc., DETECTOR.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This attack, supposed to be by Goldsmith&rsquo;s constant persecutor, the
      malignant Kenrick, drew from him the following note to the editor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&mdash;As there is nothing I dislike so much as newspaper
      controversy, particularly upon trifles, permit me to be as concise as
      possible in informing a correspondent of yours that I recommended
      Blainville&rsquo;s travels because I thought the book was a good one; and
      I think so still. I said I was told by the bookseller that it was then
      first published; but in that it seems I was misinformed, and my reading
      was not extensive enough to set me right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another correspondent of yours accuses me of having taken a ballad
      I published some time ago, from one by the ingenious Mr. Percy. I do not
      think there is any great resemblance between the two pieces in question.
      If there be any, his ballad was taken from mine. I read it to Mr. Percy
      some years ago; and he, as we both considered these things as trifles at
      best, told me, with his usual good-humor, the next time I saw him, that he
      had taken my plan to form the fragments of Shakespeare into a ballad of
      his own. He then read me his little Cento, if I may so call it, and I
      highly approved it. Such petty anecdotes as these are scarcely worth
      printing; and were it not for the busy disposition of some of your
      correspondents, the public should never have known that he owes me the
      hint of his ballad, or that I am obliged to his friendship and learning
      for communications of a much more important nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, sir, yours, etc.,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      The unexpected circulation of the Vicar of Wakefield enriched the
      publisher, but not the author. Goldsmith no doubt thought himself entitled
      to participate in the profits of the repeated editions; and a memorandum,
      still extant, shows that he drew upon Mr. Francis Newbery, in the month of
      June, for fifteen guineas, but that the bill was returned dishonored. He
      continued therefore his usual job-work for the booksellers, writing
      introductions, prefaces, and head and tail pieces for new works; revising,
      touching up, and modifying travels and voyages; making compilations of
      prose and poetry, and &ldquo;building books,&rdquo; as he sportively
      termed it. These tasks required little labor or talent, but that taste and
      touch which are the magic of gifted minds. His terms began to be
      proportioned to his celebrity. If his price was at anytime objected to,
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;it may seem large; but then a
      man may be many years working in obscurity before his taste and reputation
      are fixed or estimated; and then he is, as in other professions, only paid
      for his previous labors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, prepared to try his fortune in a different walk of
      literature from any he had yet attempted. We have repeatedly adverted to
      his fondness for the drama; he was a frequent attendant at the theaters;
      though, as we have shown, he considered them under gross mismanagement. He
      thought, too, that a vicious taste prevailed among those who wrote for the
      stage. &ldquo;A new species of dramatic composition,&rdquo; says he, in
      one of his essays, &ldquo;has been introduced under the name of
      sentimental comedy<i>, in which the virtues of private life are exhibited,
      rather than the vices exposed; and the distresses rather than the faults
      of mankind make our interest in the piece. In these plays almost all the
      characters are good and exceedingly generous; they are lavish enough of
      their tin money on the stage; and though they want humor, have abundance
      of sentiment and feeling. If they happen to have faults or foibles, the
      spectator is taught not only to pardon, but to applaud them in
      consideration of the goodness of their hearts; so that folly, instead of
      being ridiculed, is commended, and the comedy aims at touching our
      passions, without the power of being truly pathetic. In this manner we are
      likely to lose one great source of entertainment on the stage; for while
      the comic poet is invading the province of the tragic muse, he leaves her
      lively sister quite neglected. Of this, however, he is no ways solicitous,
      as he measures his fame by his profits.... </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humor at present seems to be departing from the stage; and it will
      soon happen that our comic players will have nothing left for it but a
      fine coat and a song. It depends upon the audience whether they will
      actually drive those poor merry creatures from the stage, or sit at a play
      as gloomy as at the tabernacle. It is not easy to recover an art when once
      lost; and it will be a just punishment, that when, by our being too
      fastidious, we have banished humor from the stage, we should ourselves be
      deprived of the art of laughing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Symptoms of reform in the drama had recently taken place. The comedy of
      the Clandestine Marriage, the joint production of Colman and Garrick, and
      suggested by Hogarth&rsquo;s inimitable pictures of &ldquo;Marriage a la
      mode,&rdquo; had taken the town by storm, crowded the theaters with
      fashionable audiences, and formed one of the leading literary topics of
      the year. Goldsmith&rsquo;s emulation was roused by its success. The
      comedy was in what he considered the legitimate line, totally different
      from the sentimental school; it presented pictures of real life,
      delineations of character and touches of humor, in which he felt himself
      calculated to excel. The consequence was that in the course of this year
      (1766), he commenced a comedy of the same class, to be entitled the Good
      Natured Man, at which he diligently wrought whenever the hurried
      occupation of &ldquo;book building&rdquo; allowed him leisure.

      CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      SOCIAL POSITION OF GOLDSMITH&mdash;HIS COLLOQUIAL CONTESTS WITH JOHNSON&mdash;ANECDOTES
      AND ILLUSTRATIONS
    </p>
    <p>
      THE social position of Goldsmith had undergone a material change since the
      publication of The Traveler. Before that event he was but partially known
      as the author of some clever anonymous writings, and had been a tolerated
      member of the club and the Johnson circle, without much being expected
      from him. Now he had suddenly risen to literary fame, and become one of
      the lions of the day. The highest regions of intellectual society were now
      open to him; but he was not prepared to move in them with confidence and
      success. Ballymahon had not been a good school of manners at the outset of
      life; nor had his experience as a &ldquo;poor student&rdquo; at colleges
      and medical schools contributed to give him the polish of society. He had
      brought from Ireland, as he said, nothing but his &ldquo;brogue and his
      blunders,&rdquo; and they had never left him. He had traveled, it is true;
      but the Continental tour which in those days gave the finishing grace to
      the education of a patrician youth, had, with poor Goldsmith, been little
      better than a course of literary vagabondizing. It had enriched his mind,
      deepened and widened the benevolence of his heart, and filled his memory
      with enchanting pictures, but it had contributed little to disciplining
      him for the polite intercourse of the world. His life in London had
      hitherto been a struggle with sordid cares and sad humiliations. &ldquo;You
      scarcely can conceive,&rdquo; wrote he some time previously to his
      brother, &ldquo;how much eight years of disappointment, anguish, and study
      have worn me down.&rdquo; Several more years had since been added to the
      term during which he had trod the lowly walks of life. He had been a
      tutor, an apothecary&rsquo;s drudge, a petty physician of the suburbs, a
      bookseller&rsquo;s hack, drudging for daily bread. Each separate walk had
      been beset by its peculiar thorns and humiliations. It is wonderful how
      his heart retained its gentleness and kindness through all these trials;
      how his mind rose above the &ldquo;meannesses of poverty,&rdquo; to which,
      as he says, he was compelled to submit; but it would be still more
      wonderful, had his manners acquired a tone corresponding to the innate
      grace and refinement of his intellect. He was near forty years of age when
      he published The Traveler, and was lifted by it into celebrity. As is
      beautifully said of him by one of his biographers, &ldquo;he has fought
      his way to consideration and esteem; but he bears upon him the scars of
      his twelve years&rsquo; conflict; of the mean sorrows through which he has
      passed; and of the cheap indulgences he has sought relief and help from.
      There is nothing plastic in his nature now. His manners and habits are
      completely formed; and in them any further success can make little
      favorable change, whatever it may effect for his mind or genius.&rdquo;
      [Footnote: Forster&rsquo;s Goldsmith]
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not to be surprised, therefore, at finding him make an awkward
      figure in the elegant drawing-rooms which were now open to him, and
      disappointing those who had formed an idea of him from the fascinating
      ease and gracefulness of his poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the literary club, and the circle of which it formed a part, after
      their surprise at the intellectual flights of which he showed himself
      capable, fell into a conventional mode of judging and talking of him, and
      of placing him in absurd and whimsical points of view. His very celebrity
      operated here to his disadvantage. It brought him into continual
      comparison with Johnson, who was the oracle of that circle and had given
      it a tone. Conversation was the great staple there, and of this Johnson
      was a master. He had been a reader and thinker from childhood; his
      melancholy temperament, which unfitted him for the pleasures of youth, had
      made him so. For many years past the vast variety of works he had been
      obliged to consult in preparing his Dictionary had stored an uncommonly
      retentive memory with facts on all kinds of subjects; making it a perfect
      colloquial armory. &ldquo;He had all his life,&rdquo; says Boswell,
      &ldquo;habituated himself to consider conversation as a trial of
      intellectual vigor and skill. He had disciplined himself as a talker as
      well as a writer, making it a rule to impart whatever he knew in the most
      forcible language he could put it in, so that by constant practice and
      never suffering any careless expression to escape him, he had attained an
      extraordinary accuracy and command of language.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His common conversation in all companies, according to Sir Joshua
      Reynolds, was such as to secure him universal attention, something above
      the usual colloquial style being always expected from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care,&rdquo; said Orme, the historian of Hindostan,
      &ldquo;on what subject Johnson talks; but I love better to hear him talk
      than anybody. He either gives you new thoughts or a new coloring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A stronger and more graphic eulogium is given by Dr. Percy. &ldquo;The
      conversation of Johnson,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is strong and clear, and
      may be compared to an antique statue, where every vein and muscle is
      distinct and clear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the colloquial giant with which Goldsmith&rsquo;s celebrity and
      his habits of intimacy brought him into continual comparison; can we
      wonder that he should appear to disadvantage? Conversation grave,
      discursive, and disputatious, such as Johnson excelled and delighted in,
      was to him a severe task, and he never was good at a task of any kind. He
      had not, like Johnson, a vast fund of acquired facts to draw upon; nor a
      retentive memory to furnish them forth when wanted. He could not, like the
      great lexicographer, mold his ideas and balance his periods while talking.
      He had a flow of ideas, but it was apt to be hurried and confused, and as
      he said of himself, he had contracted a hesitating and disagreeable manner
      of speaking. He used to say that he always argued best when he argued
      alone; that is to say, he could master a subject in his study, with his
      pen in his hand; but when he came into company he grew confused, and was
      unable to talk about it. Johnson made a remark concerning him to somewhat
      of the same purport. &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is more foolish
      than Goldsmith when he has not a pen in his hand, or more wise when he
      has.&rdquo; Yet with all this conscious deficiency he was continually
      getting involved in colloquial contests with Johnson and other prime
      talkers of the literary circle. He felt that he had become a notoriety;
      that he had entered the lists and was expected to make fight; so with that
      heedlessness which characterized him in everything else, he dashed on at a
      venture; trusting to chance in this as in other things, and hoping
      occasionally to make a lucky hit. Johnson perceived his hap-hazard
      temerity, but gave him no credit for the real diffidence which lay at
      bottom. &ldquo;The misfortune of Goldsmith in conversation,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;is this, he goes on without knowing how he is to get off. His
      genius is great, but his knowledge is small. As they say of a generous man
      it is a pity he is not rich, we may say of Goldsmith it is a pity he is
      not knowing. He would not keep his knowledge to himself.&rdquo; And, on
      another occasion he observes: &ldquo;Goldsmith, rather than not talk, will
      talk of what he knows himself to be ignorant, which can only end in
      exposing him. If in company with two founders, he would fall a talking on
      the method of making cannon, though both of them would soon see that he
      did not know what metal a cannon is made of.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;Goldsmith
      should not be forever attempting to shine in conversation; he has not
      temper for it, he is so much mortified when he fails. Sir, a game of jokes
      is composed partly of skill, partly of chance; a man may be beat at times
      by one who has not the tenth part of his wit. Now Goldsmith, putting
      himself against another, is like a man laying a hundred to one, who cannot
      spare the hundred. It is not worth a man&rsquo;s while. A man should not
      lay a hundred to one unless he can easily spare it, though he has a
      hundred chances for him; he can get but a guinea, and he may lose a
      hundred. Goldsmith is in this state. When he contends, if he gets the
      better, it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation;
      if he does not get the better, he is miserably vexed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson was not aware how much he was himself to blame in producing this
      vexation. &ldquo;Goldsmith,&rdquo; said Miss Reynolds, &ldquo;always
      appeared to be overawed by Johnson, particularly when in company with
      people of any consequence; always as if impressed with fear of disgrace;
      and indeed well he might. I have been witness to many mortifications he
      has suffered in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not have been disgrace that he feared, but rudeness. The great
      lexicographer, spoiled by the homage of society, was still more prone than
      himself to lose temper when the argument went against him. He could not
      brook appearing to be worsted; but would attempt to bear down his
      adversary by the rolling thunder of his periods; and when that failed,
      would become downright insulting. Boswell called it &ldquo;having recourse
      to some sudden mode of robust sophistry&rdquo;; but Goldsmith designated
      it much more happily. &ldquo;There is no arguing with Johnson,&rdquo; said
      he, <i>&ldquo;for when his pistol misses fire, he knocks you down with the
      butt end of it.&rdquo;</i> [Footnote: The following is given by Boswell as
      an instance of robust sophistry: &ldquo;Once, when I was pressing upon him
      with visible advantage, he stopped me thus, &lsquo;My dear Boswell, let&rsquo;s
      have no more of this; you&rsquo;ll make nothing of it. I&rsquo;d rather
      hear you whistle a Scotch tune.&rsquo;&rdquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      In several of the intellectual collisions recorded by Boswell as triumphs
      of Dr. Johnson, it really appears to us that Goldsmith had the best both
      of the wit and the argument, and especially of the courtesy and
      good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion he certainly gave Johnson a capital reproof as to his own
      colloquial peculiarities. Talking of fables, Goldsmith observed that the
      animals introduced in them seldom talked in character. &ldquo;For
      instance,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the fable of the little fishes, who saw
      birds fly over their heads, and, envying them, petitioned Jupiter to be
      changed into birds. The skill consists in making them talk like little
      fishes.&rdquo; Just then observing that Dr. Johnson was shaking his sides
      and laughing, he immediately added, &ldquo;Why, Dr. Johnson, this is not
      so easy as you seem to think; for if you were to make little fishes talk,
      they would talk like whales.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Goldsmith suffered frequent mortifications in society from the
      overbearing, and sometimes harsh, conduct of Johnson, he always did
      justice to his benevolence. When royal pensions were granted to Dr.
      Johnson and Dr. Shebbeare, a punster remarked that the king had pensioned
      a she-bear and a he-bear; to which Goldsmith replied, &ldquo;Johnson, to
      be sure, has a roughness in his manner, but no man alive has a more tender
      heart. <i>He has nothing of the bear but the skin.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith, in conversation, shone most when he least thought of shining;
      when he gave up all effort to appear wise and learned, or to cope with the
      oracular sententiousness of Johnson, and gave way to his natural impulses.
      Even Boswell could perceive his merits on these occasions. &ldquo;For my
      part,&rdquo; said he, condescendingly, &ldquo;I like very well to hear <i>honest
      Goldsmith</i> talk away carelessly&rdquo;; and many a much, wiser man than
      Boswell delighted in those outpourings of a fertile fancy and a generous
      heart. In his happy moods, Goldsmith had an artless simplicity and buoyant
      good-humor that led to a thousand amusing blunders and whimsical
      confessions, much to the entertainment of his intimates; yet, in his most
      thoughtless garrulity, there was occasionally the gleam of the gold and
      the flash of the diamond.

    <p>
      SOCIAL RESORTS&mdash;THE SHILLING WHIST CLUB&mdash;A PRACTICAL JOKE&mdash;THE
      WEDNESDAY CLUB&mdash;THE &ldquo;TUN OP MAN&rdquo;&mdash;THE PIG BUTCHER&mdash;TOM
      KING&mdash;HUGH KELLY&mdash;GLOVER AND HIS CHARACTERISTICS
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Goldsmith&rsquo;s pride and ambition led him to mingle occasionally
      with high society, and to engage in the colloquial conflicts of the
      learned circle, in both of which he was ill at ease and conscious of being
      undervalued, yet he had some social resorts in which he indemnified
      himself for their restraints by indulging his humor without control. One
      of them was a shilling whist club, which held its meetings at the Devil
      Tavern, near Temple Bar, a place rendered classic, we are told, by a club
      held there in old times, to which &ldquo;rare Ben Jonson&rdquo; had
      furnished the rules. The company was of a familiar, unceremonious kind,
      delighting in that very questionable wit which consists in playing off
      practical jokes upon each other. Of one of these Goldsmith was made the
      butt. Coming to the club one night in a hackney coach, he gave the
      coachman by mistake a guinea instead of a shilling, which he set down as a
      dead loss, for there was no likelihood, he said, that a fellow of this
      class would have the honesty to return the money. On the next club evening
      he was told a person at the street door wished to speak with him. He went
      forth, but soon returned with a radiant countenance. To his surprise and
      delight the coachman had actually brought back the guinea. While he
      launched forth in praise of this unlooked-for piece of honesty, he
      declared it ought not to go unrewarded. Collecting a small sum from the
      club, and no doubt increasing it largely from his own purse, he dismissed
      the Jehu with many encomiums on his good conduct. He was still chanting
      his praises when one of the club requested a sight of the guinea thus
      honestly returned. To Goldsmith&rsquo;s confusion it proved to be a
      counterfeit. The universal burst of laughter which succeeded, and the
      jokes by which he was assailed on every side, showed him that the whole
      was a hoax, and the pretended coachman as much a counterfeit as the
      guinea. He was so disconcerted, it is said, that he soon beat a retreat
      for the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of those free and easy clubs met on Wednesday evenings at the
      Globe Tavern in Fleet Street. It was somewhat in the style of the Three
      Jolly Pigeons; songs, jokes, dramatic imitations, burlesque parodies and
      broad sallies of humor, formed a contrast to the sententious morality,
      pedantic casuistry, and polished sarcasm of the learned circle. Here is a
      huge &ldquo;tun of man,&rdquo; by the name of Gordon, use to delight
      Goldsmith by singing the jovial song of Nottingham Ale, and looking like a
      butt of it. Here, too, a wealthy pig butcher, charmed, no doubt, by the
      mild philanthropy of The Traveler, aspired to be on the most sociable
      footing with the author, and here was Tom King, the comedian, recently
      risen to consequence by his performance of Lord Ogleby in the new comedy
      of the Clandestine Marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A member of more note was one Hugh Kelly, a second-rate author, who, as he
      became a kind of competitor of Goldsmith&rsquo;s, deserves particular
      mention. He was an Irishman, about twenty-eight years of age, originally
      apprenticed to a staymaker in Dublin; then writer to a London attorney;
      then a Grub Street hack, scribbling for magazines and newspapers. Of late
      he had set up for theatrical censor and satirist, and, in a paper called
      Thespis, in emulation of Churchill&rsquo;s Rosciad, had harassed many of
      the poor actors without mercy, and often without wit; but had lavished his
      incense on Garrick, who, in consequence, took him into favor. He was the
      author of several works of superficial merit, but which had sufficient
      vogue to inflate his vanity. This, however, must have been mortified on
      his first introduction to Johnson; after sitting a short time he got up to
      take leave, expressing a fear that a longer visit might be troublesome.
      &ldquo;Not in the least, sir,&rdquo; said the surly moralist, &ldquo;I had
      forgotten you were in the room.&rdquo; Johnson used to speak of him as a
      man who had written more than he had read.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prime wag of this club was one of Goldsmith&rsquo;s poor countrymen and
      hangers-on, by the name of Glover. He had originally been educated for the
      medical profession, but had taken in early life to the stage, though
      apparently without much success. While performing at Cork, he undertook,
      partly in jest, to restore life to the body of a malefactor, who had just
      been executed. To the astonishment of every one, himself among the number,
      he succeeded. The miracle took wind. He abandoned the stage, resumed the
      wig and cane, and considered his fortune as secure. Unluckily, there were
      not many dead people to be restored to life in Ireland; his practice did
      not equal his expectation, so he came to London, where he continued to
      dabble indifferently, and rather unprofitably, in physic and literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a great frequenter of the Globe and Devil taverns, where he used to
      amuse the company by his talent at story-telling and his powers of
      mimicry, giving capital imitations of Garrick, Foote, Coleman, Sterne, and
      other public characters of the day. He seldom happened to have money
      enough to pay his reckoning, but was always sure to find some ready purse
      among those who had been amused by his humors. Goldsmith, of course, was
      one of the readiest. It was through him that Glover was admitted to the
      Wednesday Club, of which his theatrical imitations became the delight.
      Glover, however, was a little anxious for the dignity of his patron, which
      appeared to him to suffer from the overfamiliarity of some of the members
      of the club. He was especially shocked by the free and easy tone in which
      Goldsmith was addressed by the pig butcher: &ldquo;Come, Noll,&rdquo;
      would he say, as he pledged him, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s my service to you,
      old boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Glover whispered to Goldsmith that he &ldquo;should not allow such
      liberties.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
      see how civilly I&rsquo;ll let him down.&rdquo; After a time, he called
      out, with marked ceremony and politeness, &ldquo;Mr. B., I have the honor
      of drinking your good health.&rdquo; Alas! dignity was not poor Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      forte: he could keep no one at a distance. &ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, thank&rsquo;ee,
      Noll,&rdquo; nodded the pig-butcher, scarce taking the pipe out of his
      mouth. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the effect of your reproof,&rdquo;
      whispered Glover. &ldquo;I give it up,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith, with a
      good-humored shrug, &ldquo;I ought to have known before now there is no
      putting a pig in the right way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson used to be severe upon Goldsmith for mingling in these motley
      circles, observing that, having been originally poor, he had contracted a
      love for low company. Goldsmith, however, was guided not by a taste for
      what was low, but for what was comic and characteristic. It was the
      feeling of the artist; the feeling which furnished out some of his best
      scenes in familiar life; the feeling with which &ldquo;rare Ben Jonson&rdquo;
      sought those very haunts and circles in days of yore, to study &ldquo;Every
      Man in His Humor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not always, however, that the humor of these associates was to his
      taste: as they became boisterous in their merriment he was apt to become
      depressed. &ldquo;The company of fools,&rdquo; says he, in one of his
      essays, &ldquo;may at first make us smile; but at last never fails of
      making us melancholy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Often he would become moody,&rdquo;
      says Glover, &ldquo;and would leave the party abruptly to go home and
      brood over his misfortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible, however, that he went home for quite a different purpose;
      to commit to paper some scene or passage suggested for his comedy of The
      Good-Natured Man. The elaboration of humor is often a most serious task;
      and we have never witnessed a more perfect picture of mental misery than
      was once presented to us by a popular dramatic writer&mdash;still, we
      hope, living&mdash;whom we found in the agonies of producing a farce which
      subsequently set the theaters in a roar.

      CHAPTER TWENTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE GREAT CHAM OF LITERATURE AND THE KING&mdash;SCENE AT SIR JOSHUA
      REYNOLDS&rsquo;&mdash;GOLDSMITH ACCUSED OF JEALOUSY&mdash;NEGOTIATIONS
      WITH GARRICK&mdash;THE AUTHOR AND THE ACTOR&mdash;THEIR CORRESPONDENCE
    </p>
    <p>
      The comedy of The Good-Natured Man was completed by Goldsmith early in
      1767, and submitted to the perusal of Johnson, Burke, Reynolds, and others
      of the literary club, by whom it was heartily approved. Johnson, who was
      seldom half way either in censure or applause, pronounced it the best
      comedy that had been written since The Provoked Husband, and promised to
      furnish the prologue. This immediately became an object of great
      solicitude with Goldsmith, knowing the weight an introduction from the
      Great Cham of literature would have with the public; but circumstances
      occurred which he feared might drive the comedy and the prologue from
      Johnson&rsquo;s thoughts. The latter was in the habit of visiting the
      royal library at the Queen&rsquo;s (Buckingham) House, a noble collection
      of books, in the formation of which he had assisted the librarian, Mr.
      Bernard, with his advice. One evening, as he was seated there by the fire
      reading, he was surprised by the entrance of the king (George III.), then
      a young man; who sought this occasion to have a conversation with him. The
      conversation was varied and discursive; the king shifting from subject to
      subject according to his wont; &ldquo;during the whole interview,&rdquo;
      says Boswell, &ldquo;Johnson talked to his majesty with profound respect,
      but still in his open, manly manner, with a sonorous voice, and never in
      that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the
      drawing-room. &lsquo;I found his majesty wished I should talk,&rsquo; said
      he, &lsquo;and I made it my business to talk. I find it does a man good to
      be talked to by his sovereign. In the first place, a man cannot be in a
      passion&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo; It would have been well for Johnson&rsquo;s
      colloquial disputants could he have often been under such decorous
      restraint. He retired from the interview highly gratified with the
      conversation of the king and with his gracious behavior. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      said he to the librarian, &ldquo;they may talk of the king as they will,
      but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      said he subsequently to Bennet Langton, &ldquo;his manners are those of as
      fine a gentleman as we may suppose Louis the Fourteenth or Charles the
      Second.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Johnson&rsquo;s face was still radiant with the reflex of royalty,
      he was holding forth one day to a listening group at Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo;,
      who were anxious to hear every particular of this memorable conversation.
      Among other questions, the king had asked him whether he was writing
      anything. His reply was that he thought he had already done his part as a
      writer. &ldquo;I should have thought so too,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;if
      you had not written so well.&rdquo; &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; said Johnson,
      commenting on this speech, &ldquo;could have made a handsomer compliment;
      and it was fit for a king to pay. It was decisive.&rdquo; &ldquo;But did
      you make no reply to this high compliment?&rdquo; asked one of the
      company. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the profoundly deferential
      Johnson, &ldquo;when the king had said it, it was to be so. It was not for
      me to bandy civilities with my sovereign.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      During all the tune that Johnson was thus holding forth, Goldsmith, who
      was present, appeared to take no interest in the royal theme, but remained
      seated on a sofa at a distance, in a moody fit of abstraction; at length
      recollecting himself, he sprang up, and advancing, exclaimed, with what
      Boswell calls his usual &ldquo;frankness and simplicity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
      you acquitted yourself in this conversation better than I should have
      done, for I should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it.&rdquo;
      He afterward explained his seeming inattention, by saying that his mind
      was completely occupied about his play, and by fears lest Johnson, in his
      present state of royal excitement, would fail to furnish the much-desired
      prologue.
    </p>
    <p>
      How natural and truthful is this explanation. Yet Boswell presumes to
      pronounce Goldsmith&rsquo;s inattention affected and attributes it to
      jealousy. &ldquo;It was strongly suspected,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that he
      was fretting with chagrin and envy at the singular honor Dr. Johnson had
      lately enjoyed.&rdquo; It needed the littleness of mind of Boswell to
      ascribe such pitiful motives to Goldsmith, and to entertain such
      exaggerated notions of the honor paid to Dr. Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Good-Natured Man was now ready for performance, but the question was
      how to get it upon the stage. The affairs of Covent Garden, for which it
      had been intended, were thrown into confusion by the recent death of Rich,
      the manager. Drury Lane was under the management of Garrick, but a feud,
      it will be recollected, existed between him and the poet, from the
      animadversions of the latter on the mismanagement of theatrical affairs,
      and the refusal of the former to give the poet his vote for the
      secretaryship of the Society of Arts. Times, however, were changed.
      Goldsmith when that feud took place was an anonymous writer, almost
      unknown to fame, and of no circulation in society. Now he had become a
      literary lion; he was a member of the Literary Club; he was the associate
      of Johnson, Burke, Topham Beauclerc, and other magnates; in a word, he had
      risen to consequence in the public eye, and of course was of consequence
      in the eyes of David Garrick. Sir Joshua Reynolds saw the lurking scruples
      of pride existing between the author and actor, and thinking it a pity
      that two men of such congenial talents, and who might be so serviceable to
      each other, should be kept asunder by a worn-out pique, exerted his
      friendly offices to bring them together. The meeting took place in
      Reynolds&rsquo; house in Leicester Square. Garrick, however, could not
      entirely put off the mock majesty of the stage; he meant to be civil, but
      he was rather too gracious and condescending. Tom Davies, in his Life of
      Garrick, gives an amusing picture of the coming together of these
      punctilious parties. &ldquo;The manager,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;was fully
      conscious of his (Goldsmith&rsquo;s) merit, and perhaps more ostentatious
      of his abilities to serve a dramatic author than became a man of his
      prudence; Goldsmith was, on his side, as fully persuaded of his own
      importance and independent greatness. Mr. Garrick, who had so long been
      treated with the complimentary language paid to a successful patentee and
      admired actor, expected that the writer would esteem the patronage of his
      play a favor; Goldsmith rejected all ideas of kindness in a bargain that
      was intended to be of mutual advantage to both parties, and in this he was
      certainly justifiable; Mr. Garrick could reasonably expect no thanks for
      the acting a new play, which he would have rejected if he had not been
      convinced it would have amply rewarded his pains and expense. I believe
      the manager was willing to accept the play, but he wished to be courted to
      it; and the doctor was not disposed to purchase his friendship by the
      resignation of his sincerity.&rdquo; They separated, however, with an
      understanding on the part of Goldsmith that his play would be acted. The
      conduct of Garrick subsequently proved evasive, not through any lingerings
      of past hostility, but from habitual indecision in matters of the kind,
      and from real scruples of delicacy. He did not think the piece likely to
      succeed on the stage, and avowed that opinion to Reynolds and Johnson; but
      hesitated to say as much to Goldsmith, through fear of wounding his
      feelings. A further misunderstanding was the result of this want of
      decision and frankness; repeated interviews and some correspondence took
      place without bringing matters to a point, and in the meantime the
      theatrical season passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s pocket, never well supplied, suffered grievously by this
      delay, and he considered himself entitled to call upon the manager, who
      still talked of acting the play, to advance him forty pounds upon a note
      of the younger Newbery. Garrick readily complied, but subsequently
      suggested certain important alterations in the comedy as indispensable to
      its success; these were indignantly rejected by the author, but
      pertinaciously insisted on by the manager. Garrick proposed to leave the
      matter to the arbitration of Whitehead, the laureate, who officiated as
      his &ldquo;reader&rdquo; and elbow critic. Goldsmith was more indignant
      than ever, and a violent dispute ensued, which was only calmed by the
      interference of Burke and Reynolds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this time, order came out of confusion in the affairs of Covent
      Garden. A pique having risen between Colman and Garrick, in the course of
      their joint authorship of The Clandestine Marriage, the former had become
      manager and part proprietor of Covent Garden, and was preparing to open a
      powerful competition with his former colleague. On hearing of this,
      Goldsmith made overtures to Colman; who, without waiting to consult his
      fellow proprietors, who were absent, gave instantly a favorable reply.
      Goldsmith felt the contrast of this warm, encouraging conduct, to the
      chilling delays and objections of Garrick. He at once abandoned his piece
      to the discretion of Colman. &ldquo;Dear sir,&rdquo; says he in a letter
      dated Temple Garden Court, July 9th, &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you
      for your kind partiality in my favor, and your tenderness in shortening
      the interval of my expectation. That the play is liable to many objections
      I well know, but I am happy that it is in hands the most capable in the
      world of removing them. If then, dear sir, you will complete your favor by
      putting the piece into such a state as it may be acted, or of directing me
      how to do it, I shall ever retain a sense of your goodness to me. And
      indeed, though most probably this be the last I shall ever write, yet I
      can&rsquo;t help feeling a secret satisfaction that poets for the future
      are likely to have a protector who declines taking advantage of their
      dreadful situation; and scorns that importance which may be acquired by
      trifling with their anxieties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Goldsmith wrote to Garrick, who was at Lichfield, informing
      him of his having transferred his piece to Covent Garden, for which it had
      been originally written, and by the patentee of which it was claimed,
      observing, &ldquo;As I found you had very great difficulties about that
      piece, I complied with his desire.... I am extremely sorry that you should
      think me warm at our last meeting; your judgment certainly ought to be
      free, especially in a matter which must in some measure concern your own
      credit and interest. I assure you, sir, I have no disposition to differ
      with you on this or any other account, but am, with a high opinion of your
      abilities, and a very real esteem, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.
      Oliver Goldsmith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his reply, Garrick observed, &ldquo;I was, indeed, much hurt that your
      warmth at our last meeting mistook my sincere and friendly attention to
      your play for the remains of a former misunderstanding, which I had as
      much forgot as if it had never existed. What I said to you at my own house
      I now repeat, that I felt more pain in giving my sentiments than you
      possibly would in receiving them. It has been the business, and ever will
      be, of my life to live on the best terms with men of genius; and I know
      that Dr. Goldsmith will have no reason to change his previous friendly
      disposition toward me, as I shall be glad of every future opportunity to
      convince him how much I am his obedient servant and well-wisher. D.
      Garrick.&rdquo;

      MORE HACK AUTHORSHIP&mdash;TOM DAVIES AND THE ROMAN HISTORY&mdash;CANONBURY
      CASTLE&mdash;POLITICAL AUTHORSHIP&mdash;PECUNIARY TEMPTATION&mdash;DEATH
      OF NEWBERY THE ELDER
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Goldsmith&rsquo;s comedy was now in train to be performed, it could
      not be brought out before Christmas; in the meantime, he must live. Again,
      therefore, he had to resort to literary jobs for his daily support. These
      obtained for him petty occasional sums, the largest of which was ten
      pounds, from the elder Newbery, for a historical compilation; but this
      scanty rill of quasi patronage, so sterile in its products, was likely
      soon to cease; Newbery being too ill to attend to business, and having to
      transfer the whole management of it to his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Tom Davies, the sometime Roscius, sometime bibliopole,
      stepped forward to Goldsmith&rsquo;s relief, and proposed that he should
      undertake an easy popular history of Rome in two volumes. An arrangement
      was soon made. Goldsmith undertook to complete it in two years, if
      possible, for two hundred and fifty guineas, and forthwith set about his
      task with cheerful alacrity. As usual, he sought a rural retreat during
      the summer months, where he might alternate his literary labors with
      strolls about the green fields. &ldquo;Merry Islington&rdquo; was again
      his resort, but he now aspired to better quarters than formerly, and
      engaged the chambers occupied occasionally by Mr. Newbery in Canonbury
      House, or Castle, as it is popularly called. This had been a hunting lodge
      of Queen Elizabeth, in whose time it was surrounded by parks and forests.
      In Goldsmith&rsquo;s day nothing remained of it but an old brick tower; it
      was still in the country, amid rural scenery, and was a favorite
      nestling-place of authors, publishers, and others of the literary order.
      [Footnote:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  See on the distant slope, majestic shows
  Old Canonbury&rsquo;s tower, an ancient pile
  To various fates assigned; and where by turns
  Meanness and grandeur have alternate reign&rsquo;d;
  Thither, in latter days, have genius fled
  From yonder city, to respire and die.
  There the sweet bard of Auburn sat, and tuned
  The plaintive moanings of his village dirge.
  There learned Chambers treasured lore for <i>men</i>,
  And Newbery there his A B C&rsquo;s for <i>babes</i>.]
</pre>
    <p>
      A number of these he had for fellow occupants of the castle; and they
      formed a temporary club, which held its meetings at the Crown Tavern, on
      the Islington lower road; and here he presided in his own genial style,
      and was the life and delight of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer of these pages visited old Canonbury Castle some years since,
      out of regard to the memory of Goldsmith. The apartment was still shown
      which the poet had inhabited, consisting of a sitting-room and small
      bedroom, with paneled wainscots and Gothic windows. The quaintness and
      quietude of the place were still attractive. It was one of the resorts of
      citizens on their Sunday walks, who would ascend to the top of the tower
      and amuse themselves with reconnoitering the city through a telescope. Not
      far from this tower were the gardens of the White Conduit House, a Cockney
      Elysium, where Goldsmith used to figure in the humbler days of his
      fortune. In the first edition of his Essays he speaks of a stroll in these
      gardens, where he at that time, no doubt, thought himself in perfectly
      genteel society. After his rise in the world, however, he became too
      knowing to speak of such plebeian haunts. In a new edition of his Essays,
      therefore, the White Conduit House and its garden disappears, and he
      speaks of &ldquo;a stroll in the Park.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While Goldsmith was literally living from hand to mouth by the forced
      drudgery of the pen, his independence of spirit was subjected to a sore
      pecuniary trial. It was the opening of Lord North&rsquo;s administration,
      a time of great political excitement. The public mind was agitated by the
      question of American taxation, and other questions of like irritating
      tendency. Junius and Wilkes and other powerful writers were attacking the
      administration with all their force; Grub Street was stirred up to its
      lowest depths; inflammatory talent of all kinds was in full activity, and
      the kingdom was deluged with pamphlets, lampoons and libels of the
      grossest kinds. The ministry were looking anxiously round for literary
      support. It was thought that the pen of Goldsmith might be readily
      enlisted. His hospitable friend and countryman, Robert Nugent, politically
      known as Squire Gawky, had come out strenuously for colonial taxation; had
      been selected for a lordship of the board of trade, and raised to the rank
      of Baron Nugent and Viscount Clare. His example, it was thought, would be
      enough of itself to bring Goldsmith into the ministerial ranks; and then
      what writer of the day was proof against a full purse or a pension?
      Accordingly one Parson Scott, chaplain to Lord Sandwich, and author of
      Anti Se anus Panurge, and other political libels in support of the
      administration, was sent to negotiate with the poet, who at this time was
      returned to town. Dr. Scott, in after years, when his political
      subserviency had been rewarded by two fat crown livings, used to make what
      he considered a good story out of this embassy to the poet. &ldquo;I found
      him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in a miserable suit of chambers in the Temple.
      I told him my authority: I told how I was empowered to pay most liberally
      for his exertions; and, would you believe it! he was so absurd as to say,
      &lsquo;I can earn as much as will supply my wants without writing for any
      party; the assistance you offer is therefore unnecessary to me&rsquo;; and
      so I left him in his garret!&rdquo; Who does not admire the sturdy
      independence of poor Goldsmith toiling in his garret for nine guineas the
      job, and smile with contempt at the indignant wonder of the political
      divine, albeit his subserviency <i>was</i> repaid by two fat crown
      livings?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this occurrence, Goldsmith&rsquo;s old friend, though
      frugal-handed employer, Newbery, of picture-book renown, closed his mortal
      career. The poet has celebrated him as the friend of all mankind; he
      certainly lost nothing by his friendship. He coined the brains of his
      authors in the times of their exigency, and made them pay dear for the
      plank put out to keep them from drowning. It is not likely his death
      caused much lamentation among the scribbling tribe; we may express decent
      respect for the memory of the just, but we shed tears only at the grave of
      the generous.

      CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

    <p>
      THEATRICAL MANEUVERING&mdash;THE COMEDY OF FALSE DELICACY&mdash;FIRST
      PERFORMANCE OF THE GOOD-NATURED MAN&mdash;CONDUCT OF JOHNSON&mdash;CONDUCT
      OF THE AUTHOR&mdash;INTERMEDDLING OF THE PRESS
    </p>
    <p>
      The comedy of The Good-Natured Man was doomed to experience delays and
      difficulties to the very last. Garrick, notwithstanding his professions,
      had still a lurking grudge against the author, and tasked his managerial
      arts to thwart him in his theatrical enterprise. For this purpose he
      undertook to build up Hugh Kelly, Goldsmith&rsquo;s boon companion of the
      Wednesday Club, as a kind of rival. Kelly had written a comedy called
      False Delicacy, in which were embodied all the meretricious qualities of
      the sentimental school. Garrick, though he had decried that school, and
      had brought out his comedy of The Clandestine Marriage in opposition to
      it, now lauded False Delicacy to the skies, and prepared to bring it out
      at Drury Lane with all possible stage effect. He even went so far as to
      write a prologue and epilogue for it, and to touch up some parts of the
      dialogue. He had become reconciled to his former colleague, Colman, and it
      is intimated that one condition in the treaty of peace between these
      potentates of the realms of pasteboard (equally prone to play into each
      other&rsquo;s hands with the confederate potentates on the great theater
      of life) was that Goldsmith&rsquo;s play should be kept back until Kelly&rsquo;s
      had been brought forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the poor author, little dreaming of the deleterious
      influence at work behind the scenes, saw the appointed time arrive and
      pass by without the performance of his play; while False Delicacy was
      brought out at Drury Lane (January 23, 1768) with all the trickery of
      managerial management. Houses were packed to applaud it to the echo; the
      newspapers vied with each other in their venal praises, and night after
      night seemed to give it a fresh triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      While False Delicacy was thus borne on the full tide of fictitious
      prosperity, The Good-Natured Man was creeping through the last rehearsals
      at Covent Garden. The success of the rival piece threw a damp upon author,
      manager, and actors. Goldsmith went about with a face full of anxiety;
      Colman&rsquo;s hopes in the piece declined at each rehearsal; as to his
      fellow proprietors, they declared they had never entertained any. All the
      actors were discontented with their parts, excepting Ned Shuter, an
      excellent low comedian, and a pretty actress named Miss Walford; both of
      whom the poor author every afterward held in grateful recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson, Goldsmith&rsquo;s growling monitor and unsparing castigator in
      times of heedless levity, stood by him at present with that protecting
      kindness with which he ever befriended him in time of need. He attended
      the rehearsals; he furnished the prologue according to promise; he pish&rsquo;d
      and pshaw&rsquo;d at any doubts and fears on the part of the author, but
      gave him sound counsel, and held him up with a steadfast and manly hand.
      Inspirited by his sympathy, Goldsmith plucked up new heart, and arrayed
      himself for the grand trial with unusual care. Ever since his elevation
      into the polite world, he had improved in his wardrobe and toilet. Johnson
      could no longer accuse him of being shabby in his appearance; he rather
      went to the other extreme. On the present occasion there is an entry in
      the books of his tailor, Mr. William Filby, of a suit of &ldquo;Tyrian
      bloom, satin grain, and garter blue silk breeches, £8 2s. 7d.&rdquo; Thus
      magnificently attired, he attended the theater and watched the reception
      of the play and the effect of each individual scene, with that vicissitude
      of feeling incident to his mercurial nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson&rsquo;s prologue was solemn in itself, and being delivered by
      Brinsley in lugubrious tones suited to the ghost in Hamlet, seemed to
      throw a portentous gloom on the audience. Some of the scenes met with
      great applause, and at such times Goldsmith was highly elated; others went
      off coldly, or there were slight tokens of disapprobation, and then his
      spirits would sink. The fourth act saved the piece; for Shuter, who had
      the main comic character of Croaker, was so varied and ludicrous in his
      execution of the scene in which he reads an incendiary letter that he drew
      down thunders of applause. On his coming behind the scenes, Goldsmith
      greeted him with an overflowing heart; declaring that he exceeded his own
      idea of the character, and made it almost as new to him as to any of the
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the whole, however, both the author and his friends were disappointed
      at the reception of the piece, and considered it a failure. Poor Goldsmith
      left the theater with his towering hopes completely cut down. He
      endeavored to hide his mortification, and even to assume an air of
      unconcern while among his associates; but, the moment he was alone with
      Dr. Johnson, in whose rough but magnanimous nature he reposed unlimited
      confidence, he threw off all restraint and gave way to an almost childlike
      burst of grief. Johnson, who had shown no want of sympathy at the proper
      time, saw nothing in the partial disappointment of overrated expectations
      to warrant such ungoverned emotions, and rebuked him sternly for what he
      termed a silly affectation, saying that &ldquo;No man should be expected
      to sympathize with the sorrows of vanity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Goldsmith had recovered from the blow, he, with his usual unreserve,
      made his past distress a subject of amusement to his friends. Dining one
      day, in company with Dr. Johnson, at the chaplain&rsquo;s table at St.
      James&rsquo;s Palace, he entertained the company with a particular and
      comic account of all his feelings on the night of representation, and his
      despair when the piece was hissed. How he went, he said, to the Literary
      Club; chatted gayly, as if nothing had gone amiss; and, to give a greater
      idea of his unconcern, sang his favorite song about an old woman tossed in
      a blanket seventeen times as high as the moon.... &ldquo;All this while,&rdquo;
      added he, &ldquo;I was suffering horrid tortures, and, had I put a bit in
      my mouth, I verily believe it would have strangled me on the spot, I was
      so excessively ill: but I made more noise than usual to cover all that; so
      they never perceived my not eating, nor suspected the anguish of my heart;
      but, when all were gone except Johnson here, I burst out a-crying, and
      even swore that I would never write again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Johnson sat in amaze at the odd frankness and childlike
      self-accusation of poor Goldsmith. When the latter had come to a pause,
      &ldquo;All this, doctor,&rdquo; said he dryly, &ldquo;I thought had been a
      secret between you and me, and I am sure I would not have said anything
      about it for the world.&rdquo; But Goldsmith had no secrets: his follies,
      his weaknesses, his errors were all thrown to the surface; his heart was
      really too guileless and innocent to seek mystery and concealment. It is
      too often the false, designing man that is guarded in his conduct and
      never offends proprieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is singular, however, that Goldsmith, who thus in conversation could
      keep nothing to himself, should be the author of a maxim which would
      inculcate the most thorough dissimulation. &ldquo;Men of the world,&rdquo;
      says he, in one of the papers of the &ldquo;Bee,&rdquo; &ldquo;maintain
      that the true end of speech is not so much to express our wants as to
      conceal them.&rdquo; How often is this quoted as one of the subtle remarks
      of the fine witted Talleyrand!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Good-Natured Man was performed for ten nights in succession; the
      third, sixth, and ninth nights were for the author&rsquo;s benefit; the
      fifth night it was commanded by their majesties; after this it was played
      occasionally, but rarely, having always pleased more in the closet than on
      the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Kelly&rsquo;s comedy, Johnson pronounced it entirely devoid of
      character, and it has long since passed into oblivion. Yet it is an
      instance how an inferior production, by dint of puffing and trumpeting,
      may be kept up for a time on the surface of popular opinion, or rather of
      popular talk. What had been done for False Delicacy on the stage was
      continued by the press. The booksellers vied with the manager in launching
      it upon the town. They announced that the first impression of three
      thousand copies was exhausted before two o&rsquo;clock on the day of
      publication; four editions, amounting to ten thousand copies, were sold in
      the course of the season; a public breakfast was given to Kelly at the
      Chapter Coffee House, and a piece of plate presented to him by the
      publishers. The comparative merits of the two plays were continually
      subjects of discussion in green-rooms, coffeehouses, and other places
      where theatrical questions were discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s old enemy, Kenrick, that &ldquo;viper of the press,&rdquo;
      endeavored on this as on many other occasions to detract from his
      well-earned fame; the poet was excessively sensitive to these attacks, and
      had not the art and self-command to conceal his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some scribblers on the other side insinuated that Kelly had seen the
      manuscript of Goldsmith&rsquo;s play, while in the hands of Garrick or
      elsewhere, and had borrowed some of the situations and sentiments. Some of
      the wags of the day took a mischievous pleasure in stirring up a feud
      between the two authors. Goldsmith became nettled, though he could
      scarcely be deemed jealous of one so far his inferior. He spoke
      disparagingly, though no doubt sincerely, of Kelly&rsquo;s play: the
      latter retorted. Still, when they met one day behind the scenes of Covent
      Garden, Goldsmith, with his customary urbanity, congratulated Kelly on his
      success. &ldquo;If I thought you sincere, Mr. Goldsmith,&rdquo; replied
      the other, abruptly, &ldquo;I should thank you.&rdquo; Goldsmith was not a
      man to harbor spleen or ill-will, and soon laughed at this unworthy
      rivalship: but the jealousy and envy awakened in Kelly&rsquo;s mind long
      continued. He is even accused of having given vent to his hostility by
      anonymous attacks in the newspapers, the basest resource of dastardly and
      malignant spirits; but of this there is no positive proof.

    </p>
    <p>
      The profits resulting from The Good-Natured Man were beyond any that
      Goldsmith had yet derived from his works. He netted about four hundred
      pounds from the theater, and one hundred pounds from his publisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five hundred pounds! and all at one miraculous draught! It appeared to him
      wealth inexhaustible. It at once opened his heart and hand, and led him
      into all kinds of extravagance. The first symptom was ten guineas sent to
      Shuter for a box ticket for his benefit, when The Good-Natured Man was to
      be performed. The next was an entire change in his domicile. The shabby
      lodgings with Jeffs the butler, in which he had been worried by Johnson&rsquo;s
      scrutiny, were now exchanged for chambers more becoming a man of his ample
      fortune. The apartments consisted of three rooms on the second floor of
      No. 2 Brick Court, Middle Temple, on the right hand ascending the
      staircase, and overlooked the umbrageous walks of the Temple garden. The
      lease he purchased for four hundred pounds, and then went on to furnish
      his rooms with mahogany sofas, card-tables, and book-cases; with curtains,
      mirrors, and Wilton carpets. His awkward little person was also furnished
      out in a style befitting his apartment; for, in addition to his suit of
      &ldquo;Tyrian bloom, satin grain,&rdquo; we find another charged about
      this time, in the books of Mr. Filby, in no less gorgeous terms, being
      &ldquo;lined with silk and furnished with gold buttons.&rdquo; Thus lodged
      and thus arrayed, he invited the visits of his most aristocratic
      acquaintances, and no longer quailed beneath the courtly eye of Beauclerc.
      He gave dinners to Johnson, Reynolds, Percy, Bickerstaff, and other
      friends of note; and supper parties to young folks of both sexes. These
      last were preceded by round games of cards, at which there was more
      laughter than skill, and in which the sport was to cheat each other; or by
      romping games of forfeits and blind-man&rsquo;s buff, at which he enacted
      the lord of misrule. Blackstone, whose chambers were immediately below,
      and who was studiously occupied on his Commentaries, used to complain of
      the racket made overhead by his reveling neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Goldsmith would make up a rural party, composed of four or five
      of his &ldquo;jolly pigeon&rdquo; friends, to enjoy what he humorously
      called a &ldquo;shoemaker&rsquo;s holiday.&rdquo; These would assemble at
      his chambers in the morning, to partake of a plentiful and rather
      expensive breakfast; the remains of which, with his customary benevolence,
      he generally gave to some poor woman in attendance. The repast ended, the
      party would set out on foot, in high spirits, making extensive rambles by
      footpaths and green lanes to Blackheath, Wandsworth, Chelsea, Hampton
      Court, Highgate, or some other pleasant resort, within a few miles of
      London. A simple but gay and heartily relished dinner, at a country inn,
      crowned the excursion. In the evening they strolled back to town, all the
      better in health and spirits for a day spent in rural and social
      enjoyment. Occasionally, when extravagantly inclined, they adjourned from
      dinner to drink tea at the White Conduit House; and, now and then,
      concluded their festive day by supping at the Grecian or Temple Exchange
      Coffee Houses, or at the Globe Tavern, in Fleet Street. The whole expenses
      of the day never exceeded a crown, and were oftener from three and
      sixpence to four shillings; for the best part of their entertainment,
      sweet air and rural scenes, excellent exercise and joyous conversation,
      cost nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Goldsmith&rsquo;s humble companions, on these excursions, was his
      occasional amanuensis, Peter Barlow, whose quaint peculiarities afforded
      much amusement to the company. Peter was poor but punctilious, squaring
      his expenses according to his means. He always wore the same garb; fixed
      his regular expenditure for dinner at a trifling sum, which, if left to
      himself, he never exceeded, but which he always insisted on paying. His
      oddities always made him a welcome companion on the &ldquo;shoemaker&rsquo;s
      holidays.&rdquo; The dinner on these occasions generally exceeded
      considerably his tariff; he put down, however, no more than his regular
      sum, and Goldsmith made up the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of these hangers-on, for whom, on such occasions, he was content
      to &ldquo;pay the shot,&rdquo; was his countryman, Glover, of whom mention
      has already been made, as one of the wags and sponges of the Globe and
      Devil taverns, and a prime mimic at the Wednesday Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vagabond genius has bequeathed us a whimsical story of one of his
      practical jokes upon Goldsmith, in the course of a rural excursion in the
      vicinity of London. They had dined at an inn on Hampstead Heights and were
      descending the hill, when, in passing a cottage, they saw through the open
      window a party at tea. Goldsmith, who was fatigued, cast a wistful glance
      at the cheerful tea-table. &ldquo;How I should like to be of that party,&rdquo;
      exclaimed he. &ldquo;Nothing more easy,&rdquo; replied Glover, &ldquo;allow
      me to introduce you.&rdquo; So saying, he entered the house with an air of
      the most perfect familiarity, though an utter stranger, and was followed
      by the unsuspecting Goldsmith, who supposed, of course, that he was a
      friend of the family. The owner of the house rose on the entrance of the
      strangers. The undaunted Glover shook hands with him in the most cordial
      manner possible, fixed his eye on one of the company who had a peculiarly
      good-natured physiognomy, muttered something like a recognition, and
      forthwith launched into an amusing story, invented at the moment, of
      something which he pretended had occurred upon the road. The host supposed
      the new-comers were friends at his guests; the guests that they were
      friends of the host. Glover did not give them time to find out the truth.
      He followed one droll story with another; brought his powers of mimicry
      into play, and kept the company in a roar. Tea was offered and accepted;
      an hour went off in the most sociable manner imaginable, at the end of
      which Glover bowed himself and his companion out of the house with many
      facetious last words, leaving the host and his company to compare notes,
      and to find out what an impudent intrusion they had experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could exceed the dismay and vexation of Goldsmith when
      triumphantly told by Glover that it was all a hoax, and that he did not
      know a single soul in the house. His first impulse was to return instantly
      and vindicate himself from all participation in the jest; but a few words
      from his free and easy companion dissuaded him. &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said
      he, coolly, &ldquo;we are unknown; you quite as much as I; if you return
      and tell the story, it will be in the newspapers to-morrow; nay, upon
      recollection I remember in one of their offices the face of that squinting
      fellow who sat in the corner as if he was treasuring up my stories for
      future use, and we shall be sure of being exposed; let us therefore keep
      our own counsel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This story was frequently afterward told by Glover, with rich dramatic
      effect, repeating and exaggerating the conversation, and mimicking in
      ludicrous style, the embarrassment, surprise, and subsequent indignation
      of Goldsmith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a trite saying that a wheel cannot run in two ruts; nor a man keep
      two opposite sets of intimates. Goldsmith sometimes found his old friends
      of the &ldquo;jolly pigeon&rdquo; order turning up rather awkwardly when
      he was in company with his new aristocratic acquaintances. He gave a
      whimiscal account of the sudden apparition of one of them at his gay
      apartments in the Temple, who may have been a welcome visitor at his
      squalid quarters in Green Arbor Court. &ldquo;How do you think he served
      me?&rdquo; said he to a friend. &ldquo;Why, sir, after staying away two
      years, he came one evening into my chambers, half drunk, as I was taking a
      glass of wine with Topham Beauclerc and General Oglethorpe; and sitting
      himself down, with most intolerable assurance inquired after my health and
      literary pursuits, as if he were upon the most friendly footing. I was at
      first so much ashamed of ever having known such a fellow that I stifled my
      resentment and drew him into a conversation on such topics as I knew he
      could talk upon; in which, to do him justice, he acquitted himself very
      reputably; when all of a sudden, as if recollecting something, he pulled
      two papers out of his pocket, which he presented to me with great
      ceremony, saying, &lsquo;Here, my dear friend, is a quarter of a pound of
      tea, and a half pound of sugar, I have brought you; for though it is not
      in my power at present to pay you the two guineas you so generously lent
      me, you, nor any man else, shall ever have it to say that I want
      gratitude.&rsquo; This,&rdquo; added Goldsmith, &ldquo;was too much. I
      could no longer keep in my feelings, but desired him to turn out of my
      chambers directly; which he very coolly did, taking up his tea and sugar;
      and I never saw him afterward.&rdquo;

    <p>
      REDUCED AGAIN TO BOOK-BUILDING&mdash;RURAL RETREAT AT SHOEMAKER&rsquo;S
      PARADISE&mdash;DEATH OF HENRY GOLDSMITH&mdash;TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY IN
      THE DESERTED VILLAGE
    </p>
    <p>
      The heedless expenses of Goldsmith, as may easily be supposed, soon
      brought him to the end of his &ldquo;prize money,&rdquo; but when his
      purse gave out he drew upon futurity, obtaining advances from his
      booksellers and loans from his friends in the confident hope of soon
      turning up another trump. The debts which he thus thoughtlessly incurred
      in consequence of a transient gleam of prosperity embarrassed him for the
      rest of his life; so that the success of The Good-Natured Man may be said
      to have been ruinous to him. He was soon obliged to resume his old craft
      of book-building, and set about his History of Rome, undertaken for
      Davies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his custom, as we have shown, during the summer time, when pressed
      by a multiplicity of literary jobs, or urged to the accomplishment of some
      particular task, to take country lodgings a few miles from town, generally
      on the Harrow or Edgeware roads, and bury himself there for weeks and
      months together. Sometimes he would remain closely occupied in his room,
      at other times he would stroll out along the lanes and hedge-rows, and
      taking out paper and pencil, note down thoughts to be expanded and
      connected at home. His summer retreat for the present year, 1768, was a
      little cottage with a garden, pleasantly situated about eight miles from
      town on the Edgeware road. He took it in conjunction with a Mr. Edmund
      Botts, a barrister and man of letters, his neighbor in the Temple, having
      rooms Immediately opposite him on the same floor. They had become cordial
      intimates, and Botts was one of those with whom Goldsmith now and then
      took the friendly but pernicious liberty of borrowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage which they had hired belonged to a rich shoemaker of
      Piccadilly, who had embellished his little domain of half an acre with
      statues and jets, and all the decorations of landscape gardening; in
      consequence of which Goldsmith gave it the name of The Shoemaker&rsquo;s
      Paradise. As his fellow-occupant, Mr. Botts, drove a gig, he sometimes, in
      an interval of literary labor, accompanied him to town, partook of a
      social dinner there, and returned with him in the evening. On one
      occasion, when they had probably lingered too long at the table, they came
      near breaking their necks on their way homeward by driving against a post
      on the sidewalk, while Botts was proving by the force of legal eloquence
      that they were in the very middle of the broad Edgeware road.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this summer Goldsmith&rsquo;s career of gayety was
      suddenly brought to a pause by intelligence of the death of his brother
      Henry, then but forty-five years of age. He had led a quiet and blameless
      life amid the scenes of his youth, fulfilling the duties of village pastor
      with unaffected piety; conducting the school at Lissoy with a degree of
      industry and ability that gave it celebrity, and acquitting himself in all
      the duties of life with undeviating rectitude and the mildest benevolence.
      How truly Goldsmith loved and venerated him is evident in all his letters
      and throughout his works; in which his brother continually forms his model
      for an exemplification of all the most endearing of the Christian virtues;
      yet his affection at his death was imbittered by the fear that he died
      with some doubt upon his mind of the warmth of his affection. Goldsmith
      had been urged by his friends in Ireland, since his elevation in the
      world, to use his influence with the great, which they supposed to be all
      powerful, in favor of Henry, to obtain for him church preferment. He did
      exert himself as far as his diffident nature would permit, but without
      success; we have seen that, in the case of the Earl of Northumberland,
      when, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, that nobleman proffered him his
      patronage, he asked nothing for himself, but only spoke on behalf of his
      brother. Still some of his friends, ignorant of what he had done and of
      how little he was able to do, accused him of negligence. It is not likely,
      however, that his amiable and estimable brother joined in the accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the tender and melancholy recollections of his early days awakened by
      the death of this loved companion of his childhood, we may attribute some
      of the most heartfelt passages in his Deserted Village. Much of that poem,
      we are told, was composed this summer, in the course of solitary strolls
      about the green lanes and beautifully rural scenes of the neighborhood;
      and thus much of the softness and sweetness of English landscape became
      blended with the ruder features of Lissoy. It was in these lonely and
      subdued moments, when tender regret was half mingled with self-upbraiding,
      that he poured forth that homage of the heart, rendered, as it were, at
      the grave of his brother. The picture of the village pastor in this poem,
      which, we have already hinted, was taken in part from the character of his
      father, embodied likewise the recollections of his brother Henry; for the
      natures of the father and son seem to have been identical. In the
      following lines, however, Goldsmith evidently contrasted the quiet,
      settled life of his brother, passed at home in the benevolent exercise of
      the Christian duties, with his own restless, vagrant career:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Remote from towns he ran his goodly race,
  Nor e&rsquo;er had changed, nor wished to change his place.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      To us the whole character seems traced, as it were, in an expiatory
      spirit; as if, conscious of his own wandering restlessness, he sought to
      humble himself at the shrine of excellence which he had not been able to
      practice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
  His looks adorn&rsquo;d the venerable place;
  Truth from his lips prevail&rsquo;d with double sway,
  And fools, who came to scoff, remain&rsquo;d to pray.
  The service past, around the pious man,
  With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;
  Even children follow&rsquo;d, with endearing wile,
  And pluck&rsquo;d his gown, to share the good man&rsquo;s smile;
  His ready smile a parent&rsquo;s warmth express&rsquo;d,
  Their welfare pleas&rsquo;d him, and their cares distress&rsquo;d;
  To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
  But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.

      DINNER AT BICKERSTAFF&rsquo;S&mdash;HIFFERNAN AND HIS IMPECUNIOSITY&mdash;KENRICK&rsquo;S
      EPIGRAM&mdash;JOHNSON&rsquo;S CONSOLATION&mdash;GOLDSMITH&rsquo;S TOILET&mdash;THE
      BLOOM-COLORED COAT&mdash;NEW ACQUAINTANCES&mdash;THE HORNECKS&mdash;A
      TOUCH OF POETRY AND PASSION&mdash;THE JESSAMY BRIDE
    </p>
    <p>
      In October Goldsmith returned to town and resumed his usual haunts. We
      hear of him at a dinner given by his countryman, Isaac Bickerstaff, author
      of Love in a Village, Lionel and Clarissa, and other successful dramatic
      pieces. The dinner was to be followed by the reading by Bickerstaff of a
      new play. Among the guests was one Paul Hiffernan, likewise an Irishman;
      somewhat idle and intemperate; who lived nobody knew how nor where,
      sponging wherever he had a chance, and often of course upon Goldsmith, who
      was ever the vagabond&rsquo;s friend, or rather victim. Hiffernan was
      something of a physician, and elevated the emptiness of his purse into the
      dignity of a disease, which he termed <i>impecuniosity</i>, and against
      which he claimed a right to call for relief from the healthier purses of
      his friends. He was a scribbler for the newspapers, and latterly a
      dramatic critic, which had probably gained him an invitation to the dinner
      and reading. The wine and wassail, however, befogged his senses. Scarce
      had the author got into the second act of his play, when Hiffernan began
      to nod, and at length snored outright. Bickerstaff was embarrassed, but
      continued to read in a more elevated tone. The louder he read, the louder
      Hiffernan snored; until the author came to a pause. &ldquo;Never mind the
      brute, Bick, but go on,&rdquo; cried Goldsmith. &ldquo;He would have
      served Homer just so if he were here and reading his own works.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenrick, Goldsmith&rsquo;s old enemy, travestied this anecdote in the
      following lines, pretending that the poet had compared his countryman
      Bickerstaff to Homer.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;What are your Bretons, Romans, Grecians,
  Compared with thoroughbred Milesians!
  Step into Griffin&rsquo;s shop, he&rsquo;ll tell ye
  Of Goldsmith, Bickerstaff, and Kelly ...
  And, take one Irish evidence for t&rsquo;other,
  Ev&rsquo;n Homer&rsquo;s self is but their foster brother.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Johnson was a rough consoler to a man when wincing under an attack of this
      kind. &ldquo;Never mind, sir,&rdquo; said he to Goldsmith, when he saw
      that he felt the sting. &ldquo;A man whose business it is to be talked of
      is much helped by being attacked. Fame, sir, is a shuttlecock; if it be
      struck only at one end of the room, it will soon fall to the ground; to
      keep it up, it must be struck at both ends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bickerstaff, at the time of which we are speaking, was in high vogue, the
      associate of the first wits of the day; a few years afterward he was
      obliged to fly the country to escape the punishment of an infamous crime.
      Johnson expressed great astonishment at hearing the offense for which he
      had fled. &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; said Thrale; &ldquo;he had long been a
      suspected man.&rdquo; Perhaps there was a knowing look on the part of the
      eminent brewer, which provoked a somewhat contemptuous reply. &ldquo;By
      those who look close to the ground,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;dirt will
      sometimes be seen; I hope I see things from a greater distance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already noticed the improvement, or rather the increased expense,
      of Goldsmith&rsquo;s wardrobe since his elevation into polite society.
      &ldquo;He was fond,&rdquo; says one of his contemporaries, &ldquo;of
      exhibiting his muscular little person in the gayest apparel of the day, to
      which was added a bag-wig and sword.&rdquo; Thus arrayed, he used to
      figure about in the sunshine in the Temple Gardens, much to his own
      satisfaction, but to the amusement of his acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell, in his memoirs, has rendered one of his suits forever famous.
      That worthy, on the 16th of October in this same year, gave a dinner to
      Johnson, Goldsmith, Reynolds, Garrick, Murphy, Bickerstaff, and Davies.
      Goldsmith was generally apt to bustle in at the last moment, when the
      guests were taking their seats at table, but on this occasion he was
      unusually early. While waiting for some lingerers to arrive, &ldquo;he
      strutted about,&rdquo; says Boswell, &ldquo;bragging of his dress, and I
      believe was seriously vain of it, for his mind was undoubtedly prone to
      such impressions. &lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said Garrick, &lsquo;talk no
      more of that. You are perhaps the worst&mdash;eh, eh?&rsquo; Goldsmith was
      eagerly attempting to interrupt him, when Garrick went on, laughing
      ironically, &lsquo;Nay, you will always <i>look</i> like a gentleman; but
      I am talking of your being well or <i>ill dressed</i>.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,
      let me tell you,&rsquo; said Goldsmith, &lsquo;when the tailor brought
      home my bloom-colored coat, he said, &lsquo;Sir, I have a favor to beg of
      you; when anybody asks you who made your clothes, be pleased to mention
      John Filby, at the Harrow, in Water Lane.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo;
      cried Johnson, &lsquo;that was because he knew the strange color would
      attract crowds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of him, and see how
      well he could make a coat of so absurd a color.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Goldsmith might permit this raillery on the part of his
      friends, he was quick to resent any personalities of the kind from
      strangers. As he was one day walking the Strand in grand array with
      bag-wig and sword, he excited the merriment of two coxcombs, one of whom
      called to the other to &ldquo;look at that fly with a long pin stuck
      through it.&rdquo; Stung to the quick, Goldsmith&rsquo;s first retort was
      to caution the passers-by to be on their guard against &ldquo;that brace
      of disguised pickpockets&rdquo;&mdash;his next was to step into the middle
      of the street, where there was room for action, half draw his sword, and
      beckon the joker, who was armed in like manner, to follow him. This was
      literally a war of wit which the other had not anticipated. He had no
      inclination to push the joke to such an extreme, but abandoning the
      ground, sneaked off with his brother wag amid the hootings of the
      spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      This proneness to finery in dress, however, which Boswell and others of
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s contemporaries, who did not understand the secret plies
      of his character, attributed to vanity, arose, we are convinced, from a
      widely different motive. It was from a painful idea of his own personal
      defects, which had been cruelly stamped upon his mind in his boyhood by
      the sneers and jeers of his playmates, and had been ground deeper into it
      by rude speeches made to him in every step of his struggling career, until
      it had become a constant cause of awkwardness and embarrassment. This he
      had experienced the more sensibly since his reputation had elevated him
      into polite society; and he was constantly endeavoring by the aid of dress
      to acquire that personal <i>acceptability</i>, if we may use the phrase,
      which nature had denied him. If ever he betrayed a little self-complacency
      on first turning out in a new suit, it may perhaps have been because he
      felt as if he had achieved a triumph over his ugliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were circumstances too about the time of which we are treating which
      may have rendered Goldsmith more than usually attentive to his personal
      appearance. He had recently made the acquaintance of a most agreeable
      family from Devonshire, which he met at the house of his friend, Sir
      Joshua Reynolds. It consisted of Mrs. Horneck, widow of Captain Kane
      Horneck; two daughters, seventeen and nineteen years of age, and an only
      son, Charles, &ldquo;the Captain in Lace,&rdquo; as his sisters playfully
      and somewhat proudly called him, he having lately entered the Guards. The
      daughters are described as uncommonly beautiful, intelligent, sprightly,
      and agreeable. Catharine, the eldest, went among her friends by the name
      of &ldquo;Little Comedy,&rdquo; indicative, very probably, of her
      disposition. She was engaged to William Henry Bunbury, second son of a
      Suffolk baronet. The hand and heart of her sister Mary were yet unengaged,
      although she bore the by-name among her friends of the &ldquo;Jessamy
      Bride.&rdquo; This family was prepared, by their intimacy with Reynolds
      and his sister, to appreciate the merits of Goldsmith. The poet had always
      been a chosen friend of the eminent painter, and Miss Reynolds, as we have
      shown, ever since she had heard his poem of The Traveler read aloud, had
      ceased to consider him ugly. The Hornecks were equally capable of
      forgetting his person in admiring his works. On becoming acquainted with
      him, too, they were delighted with his guileless simplicity; his buoyant
      good-nature and his innate benevolence, and an enduring intimacy soon
      sprang up between them. For once poor Goldsmith had met with polite
      society with which he was perfectly at home, and by which he was fully
      appreciated; for once he had met with lovely women, to whom his ugly
      features were not repulsive. A proof of the easy and playful terms in
      which he was with them remains in a whimsical epistle in verse, of which
      the following was the occasion. A dinner was to be given to their family
      by a Dr. Baker, a friend of their mother&rsquo;s, at which Reynolds and
      Angelica Kauffman were to be present. The young ladies were eager to have
      Goldsmith of the party, and their intimacy with Dr. Baker allowing them to
      take the liberty, they wrote a joint invitation to the poet at the last
      moment. It came too late, and drew from him the following reply; on the
      top of which was scrawled, &ldquo;This is a poem! This <i>is</i> a copy of
      verses!&rdquo;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Your mandate I got,
  You may all go to pot;
  Had your senses been right,
  You&rsquo;d have sent before night&mdash;
  So tell Horneck and Nesbitt,
  And Baker and his bit,
  And Kauffman beside,
  And the <i>Jessamy Bride</i>,
  With the rest of the crew.
  The Reynoldses too,
  <i>Little Comedy&rsquo;s</i> face,
  And the <i>Captain in Lace</i>&mdash;
  Tell each other to rue
  Your Devonshire crew,
  For sending so late
  To one of my state.
  But &rsquo;tis Reynolds&rsquo;s way
  From wisdom to stray,
  And Angelica&rsquo;s whim
  To befrolic like him;
  But alas! your good worships, how could they be wiser,
  When both have been spoil&rsquo;d in to-day&rsquo;s &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      [Footnote: The following lines had appeared in that day&rsquo;s &ldquo;Advertiser,&rdquo;
      on the portrait of Sir Joshua by Angelica Kauffman:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;While fair Angelica, with matchless grace,
  Paints Conway&rsquo;s burly form and Stanhope&rsquo;s face;
  Our hearts to beauty willing homage pay,
  We praise, admire, and gaze our souls away.

  But when the likeness she hath done for thee,
  O Reynolds! with astonishment we see,
  Forced to submit, with all our pride we own,
  Such strength, such harmony excelled by none.
  And thou art rivaled by thyself alone.&rdquo;]
</pre>
    <p>
      It has been intimated that the intimacy of poor Goldsmith with the Misses
      Horneck, which began in so sprightly a vein, gradually assumed something
      of a more tender nature, and that he was not insensible to the
      fascinations of the younger sister. This may account for some of the
      phenomena which about this time appeared in his wardrobe and toilet.
      During the first year of his acquaintance with these lovely girls, the
      tell-tale book of his tailor, Mr. William Filby, displays entries of four
      or five full suits, besides separate articles of dress. Among the items we
      find a green half-trimmed frock and breeches, lined with silk; a queen&rsquo;s
      blue dress suit; a half dress suit of ratteen, lined with satin; a pair of
      silk stocking breeches, and another pair of bloom color. Alas! poor
      Goldsmith! how much of this silken finery was dictated, not by vanity, but
      humble consciousness of thy defects; how much of it was to atone for the
      uncouthness of thy person, and to win favor in the eyes of the Jessamy
      Bride!

      GOLDSMITH IN THE TEMPLE&mdash;JUDGE DAY AND GRATTAN&mdash;LABOR AND
      DISSIPATION&mdash;PUBLICATION OF THE ROMAN HISTORY&mdash;OPINIONS OF IT&mdash;HISTORY
      OF ANIMATED NATURE&mdash;TEMPLE ROOKERY&mdash;ANECDOTES OF A SPIDER
    </p>
    <p>
      In the winter of 1768-69 Goldsmith occupied himself at his quarters in the
      Temple, slowly &ldquo;building up&rdquo; his Roman History. We have
      pleasant views of him in this learned and half-cloistered retreat of wit
      and lawyers and legal students, in the reminiscences of Judge Day of the
      Irish Bench, who in his advanced age delighted to recall the days of his
      youth, when he was a templar, and to speak of the kindness with which he
      and his fellow-student, Grattan, were treated by the poet. &ldquo;I was
      just arrived from college,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;full freighted with
      academic gleanings, and our author did not disdain to receive from me some
      opinions and hints toward his Greek and Roman histories. Being then a
      young man, I felt much flattered by the notice of so celebrated a person.
      He took great delight in the conversation of Grattan, whose brilliancy in
      the morning of life furnished full earnest of the unrivaled splendor which
      awaited his meridian; and finding us dwelling together in Essex Court,
      near himself, where he frequently visited my immortal friend, his warm
      heart became naturally prepossessed toward the associate of one whom he so
      much admired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge goes on, in his reminiscences, to give a picture of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      social habits, similar in style to those already furnished. He frequented
      much the Grecian Coffee-House, then the favorite resort of the Irish and
      Lancashire Templars. He delighted in collecting his friends around him at
      evening parties at his chambers, where he entertained them with a cordial
      and unostentatious hospitality. &ldquo;Occasionally,&rdquo; adds the
      judge, &ldquo;he amused them with his flute, or with whist, neither of
      which he played well, particularly the latter, but, on losing his money,
      he never lost his temper. In a run of bad luck and worse play, he would
      fling his cards upon the floor and exclaim, &lsquo;<i>Byefore</i> George,
      I ought forever to renounce thee, fickle, faithless Fortune.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge was aware at the time that all the learned labor of poor
      Goldsmith upon his Roman History was mere hack work to recruit his
      exhausted finances. &ldquo;His purse replenished,&rdquo; adds he, &ldquo;by
      labors of this kind, the season of relaxation and pleasure took its turn,
      in attending the theaters, Ranelagh, Vauxhall, and other scenes of gayety
      and amusement. Whenever his funds were dissipated&mdash;and they fled more
      rapidly from being the dupe of many artful persons, male and female, who
      practiced upon his benevolence&mdash;he returned to his literary labors,
      and shut himself up from society to provide fresh matter for his
      bookseller, and fresh supplies for himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How completely had the young student discerned the characteristics of
      poor, genial, generous, drudging, holiday-loving Goldsmith; toiling that
      he might play; earning his bread by the sweat of his brains, and then
      throwing it out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Roman History was published in the middle of May, in two volumes of
      five hundred pages each. It was brought out without parade or pretension,
      and was announced as for the use of schools and colleges; but, though a
      work written for bread, not fame, such is its ease, perspicuity, good
      sense, and the delightful simplicity of its style, that it was well
      received by the critics, commanded a prompt and extensive sale, and has
      ever since remained in the hands of young and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson, who, as we have before remarked, rarely praised or dispraised
      things by halves, broke forth in a warm eulogy of the author and the work,
      in a conversation with Boswell, to the great astonishment of the latter.
      &ldquo;Whether we take Goldsmith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as a poet, as a
      comic writer, or as a historian, he stands in the first class.&rdquo;
      Boswell.&mdash;&ldquo;A historian! My dear sir, you surely will not rank
      his compilation of the Roman History with the works of other historians of
      this age.&rdquo; Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;Why, who are before him?&rdquo;
      Boswell.&mdash;&ldquo;Hume&mdash;Robertson&mdash;Lord Lyttelton.&rdquo;
      Johnson (his antipathy against the Scotch beginning to rise).&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have not read Hume; but doubtless Goldsmith&rsquo;s History is better than
      the verbiage of Robertson, or the foppery of Dalrymple.&rdquo; Boswell.&mdash;&ldquo;Will
      you not admit the superiority of Robertson, in whose history we find such
      penetration, such painting?&rdquo; Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, you must
      consider how that penetration and that painting are employed. It is not
      history, it is imagination. He who describes what he never saw, draws from
      fancy. Robertson paints minds as Sir Joshua paints faces, in a
      history-piece; he imagines a heroic countenance. You must look upon
      Robertson&rsquo;s work as romance, and try it by that standard. History it
      is not. Besides, sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into
      his book as much as his book will hold. Goldsmith has done this in his
      history. Now Robertson might have put twice as much in his book. Robertson
      is like a man who has packed gold in wool; the wool takes up more room
      than the gold. No, sir, I always thought Robertson would be crushed with
      his own weight&mdash;would be buried under his own ornaments. Goldsmith
      tells you shortly all you want to know; Robertson detains you a great deal
      too long. No man will read Robertson&rsquo;s cumbrous detail a second
      time; but Goldsmith&rsquo;s plain narrative will please again and again. I
      would say to Robertson what an old tutor of a college said to one of his
      pupils, &lsquo;Read over your compositions, and whenever you meet with a
      passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out!&rsquo;&mdash;Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      abridgment is better than that of Lucius Floras or Eutropius; and I will
      venture to say, that if you compare him with Vertot in the same places of
      the Roman History, you will find that he excels Vertot. Sir, he has the
      art of compiling, and of saying everything he has to say in a pleasing
      manner. He is now writing a Natural History, and will make it as
      entertaining as a Persian tale.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Natural History to which Johnson alluded was the History of Animated
      Nature, which Goldsmith commenced in 1769, under an engagement with
      Griffin, the bookseller, to complete it as soon as possible in eight
      volumes, each containing upward of four hundred pages, in pica; a hundred
      guineas to be paid to the author on the delivery of each volume in
      manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was induced to engage in this work by the urgent solicitations of the
      booksellers, who had been struck by the sterling merits and captivating
      style of an introduction which he wrote to Brookes&rsquo; Natural History.
      It was Goldsmith&rsquo;s intention originally to make a translation of
      Pliny, with a popular commentary; but the appearance of Buffon&rsquo;s
      work induced him to change his plan and make use of that author for a
      guide and model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cumberland, speaking of this work, observes: &ldquo;Distress drove
      Goldsmith upon undertakings neither congenial with his studies nor worthy
      of his talents. I remember him when, in his chambers in the Temple, he
      showed me the beginning of his Animated Nature; it was with a sigh, such
      as genius draws when hard necessity diverts it from its bent to drudge for
      bread, and talk of birds, and beasts, and creeping things, which Pidock&rsquo;s
      showman would have done as well. Poor fellow, he hardly knows an ass from
      a mule, nor a turkey from a goose, but when he sees it on the table.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Others of Goldsmith&rsquo;s friends entertained similar ideas with respect
      to his fitness for the task, and they were apt now and then to banter him
      on the subject, and to amuse themselves with his easy credulity. The
      custom among the natives of Otaheite of eating dogs being once mentioned
      in company, Goldsmith observed that a similar custom prevailed in China;
      that a dog-butcher is as common there as any other butcher; and that when
      he walks abroad all the dogs fall on him. Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;That is
      not owing to his killing dogs; sir, I remember a butcher at Litchfield,
      whom a dog that was in the house where I lived always attacked. It is the
      smell of carnage which provokes this, let the animals he has killed be
      what they may.&rdquo; Goldsmith.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, there is a general
      abhorrence in animals at the signs of massacre. If you put a tub full of
      blood into a stable, the horses are likely to go mad.&rdquo; Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      doubt that.&rdquo; Goldsmith.&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, sir, it is a fact well
      authenticated.&rdquo; Thrale.&mdash;&ldquo;You had better prove it before
      you put it into your book on Natural History. You may do it in my stable
      if you will.&rdquo; Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;Nay, sir, I would not have him
      prove it. If he is content to take his information from others, he may get
      through his book with little trouble, and without much endangering his
      reputation. But if he makes experiments for so comprehensive a book as
      his, there would be no end to them; his erroneous assertions would fall
      then upon himself; and he might be blamed for not having made experiments
      as to every particular.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson&rsquo;s original prediction, however, with respect to this work,
      that Goldsmith would make it as entertaining as a Persian tale, was
      verified; and though much of it was borrowed from Buffon, and but little
      of it written from his own observation; though it was by no means
      profound, and was chargeable with many errors, yet the charms of his style
      and the play of his happy disposition throughout have continued to render
      it far more popular and readable than many works on the subject of much
      greater scope and science. Cumberland was mistaken, however, in his notion
      of Goldsmith&rsquo;s ignorance and lack of observation as to the
      characteristics of animals. On the contrary, he was a minute and shrewd
      observer of them; but he observed them with the eye of a poet and moralist
      as well as a naturalist. We quote two passages from his works illustrative
      of this fact, and we do so the more readily because they are in a manner a
      part of his history, and give us another peep into his private life in the
      Temple; of his mode of occupying himself in his lonely and apparently idle
      moments, and of another class of acquaintances which he made there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking in his Animated Nature of the habitudes of Rooks, &ldquo;I have
      often amused myself,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;with observing their plans of
      policy from my window in the Temple, that looks upon a grove, where they
      have made a colony in the midst of a city. At the commencement of spring
      the rookery, which, during the continuance of winter, seemed to have been
      deserted, or only guarded by about five or six, like old soldiers in a
      garrison, now begins to be once more frequented; and in a short time, all
      the bustle and hurry of business will be fairly commenced.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other passage, which we take the liberty to quote at some length, is
      from an admirable paper in the &ldquo;Bee,&rdquo; and relates to the House
      Spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all the solitary insects I have ever remarked, the spider is the
      most sagacious, and its motions to me, who have attentively considered
      them, seem almost to exceed belief.... I perceived, about four years ago,
      a large spider in one corner of my room making its web; and, though the
      maid frequently leveled her broom against the labors of the little animal,
      I had the good fortune then to prevent its destruction, and I may say it
      more than paid me by the entertainment it afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three days the web was, with incredible diligence, completed;
      nor could I avoid thinking that the insect seemed to exult in its new
      abode. It frequently traversed it round, examined the strength of every
      part of it, retired into its hole, and came out very frequently. The first
      enemy, however, it had to encounter was another and a much larger spider,
      which, having no web of its own, and having probably exhausted all its
      stock in former labors of this kind, came to invade the property of its
      neighbor. Soon, then, a terrible encounter ensued, in which the invader
      seemed to have the victory, and the laborious spider was obliged to take
      refuge in its hole. Upon this I perceived the victor using every art to
      draw the enemy from its stronghold. He seemed to go off, but quickly
      returned; and when he found all arts in vain, began to demolish the new
      web without mercy. This brought on another battle, and, contrary to my
      expectations, the laborious spider became conqueror, and fairly killed his
      antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, in peaceable possession of what was justly its own, it
      waited three days with the utmost patience, repairing the breaches of its
      web, and taking no sustenance that I could perceive. At last, however, a
      large blue fly fell into the snare, and struggled hard to get loose. The
      spider gave it leave to entangle itself as much as possible, but it seemed
      to be too strong for the cobweb. I must own I was greatly surprised when I
      saw the spider immediately sally out, and in less than a minute weave a
      new net round its captive, by which the motion of its wings was stopped;
      and when it was fairly hampered in this manner it was seized and dragged
      into the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this manner it lived, in a precarious state; and nature seemed
      to have fitted it for such a life, for upon a single fly it subsisted for
      more than a week. I once put a wasp into the net; but when the spider came
      out in order to seize it, as usual, upon perceiving what kind of an enemy
      it had to deal with, it instantly broke all the bands that held it fast,
      and contributed all that lay in its power to disengage so formidable an
      antagonist. When the wasp was set at liberty, I expected the spider would
      have set about repairing the breaches that were made in its net; but
      those, it seems, were irreparable; wherefore the cobweb was now entirely
      forsaken, and a new one begun, which was completed in the usual time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had now a mind to try how many cobwebs a single spider could
      furnish; wherefore I destroyed this, and the insect set about another.
      When I destroyed the other also, its whole stock seemed entirely
      exhausted, and it could spin no more. The arts it made use of to support
      itself, now deprived of its great means of subsistence, were indeed
      surprising. I have seen it roll up its legs like a ball, and lie
      motionless for hours together, but cautiously watching all the time; when
      a fly happened to approach sufficiently near, it would dart out all at
      once, and often seize its prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of this life, however, it soon began to grow weary, and resolved to
      invade the possession of some other spider, since it could not make a web
      of its own. It formed an attack upon a neighboring fortification with
      great vigor, and at first was as vigorously repulsed. Not daunted,
      however, with one defeat, in this manner it continued to lay siege to
      another&rsquo;s web for three days, and at length, having killed the
      defendant, actually took possession. When smaller flies happen to fall
      into the snare, the spider does not sally out at once, but very patiently
      waits till it is sure of them; for, upon his immediately approaching the
      terror of his appearance might give the captive strength sufficient to get
      loose; the manner, then, is to wait patiently, till, by ineffectual and
      impotent struggles, the captive has wasted all its strength, and then he
      becomes a certain and easy conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The insect I am now describing lived three years; every year it
      changed its skin and got a new set of legs. I have sometimes plucked off a
      leg, which grew again in two or three days. At first it dreaded my
      approach to its web, but at last it became so familiar as to take a fly
      out of my hand; and, upon my touching any part of the web, would
      immediately leave its hole, prepared either for a defense or an attack.&rdquo;

      HONORS AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY&mdash;LETTER TO HIS BROTHER MAURICE&mdash;FAMILY
      FORTUNES&mdash;JANE CONTARINE AND THE MINIATURE&mdash;PORTRAITS AND
      ENGRAVINGS&mdash;SCHOOL ASSOCIATIONS&mdash;JOHNSON AND GOLDSMITH IN
      WESTMINSTER ABBEY
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of the year 1768 had been made memorable in the world of
      taste by the institution of the Royal Academy of Arts, under the patronage
      of the king, and the direction of forty of the most distinguished artist.
      Reynolds, who had been mainly instrumental in founding it, had been
      unanimously elected president, and had thereupon received the honor of
      knighthood. [Footnote: We must apologize for the anachronism we have
      permitted ourselves, in the course of this memoir, in speaking of Reynolds
      as <i>Sir Joshua</i>, when treating of circumstances which occurred prior
      to his being dubbed; but it is so customary to speak of him by that title
      that we found it difficult to dispense with it.] Johnson was so delighted
      with his friend&rsquo;s elevation that he broke through a rule of total
      abstinence with respect to wine, which he had maintained for several
      years, and drank bumpers on the occasion. Sir Joshua eagerly sought to
      associate his old and valued friends with him in his new honors, and it is
      supposed to be through his suggestions that, on the first establishment of
      professorships, which took place in December, 1769, Johnson was nominated
      to that of Ancient Literature, and Goldsmith to that of History. They were
      mere honorary titles, without emolument, but gave distinction, from the
      noble institution to which they appertained. They also gave the possessors
      honorable places at the annual banquet, at which were assembled many of
      the most distinguished persons of rank and talent, all proud to be classed
      among the patrons of the arts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter of Goldsmith to his brother alludes to the foregoing
      appointment, and to a small legacy bequeathed to him by his uncle
      Contarine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>To Mr. Maurice Goldsmith, at James Lawders, Esq., at Kilmore,
      near Carrick-on-Shannon.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;January, 1770.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR BROTHER&mdash;I should have answered your letter sooner, but,
      in truth, I am not fond of thinking of the necessities of those I love,
      when it is so very little in my power to help them. I am sorry to find you
      are every way unprovided for; and what adds to my uneasiness is, that I
      have received a letter from my sister Johnson, by which I learn that she
      is pretty much in the same circumstances. As to myself, I believe I think
      I could get both you and my poor brother-in-law something like that which
      you desire, but I am determined never to ask for little things, nor
      exhaust any little interest I may have, until I can serve you, him, and
      myself more effectually. As yet, no opportunity has offered; but I believe
      you are pretty well convinced that I will not be remiss when it arrives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king has lately been pleased to make me Professor of Ancient
      History in the Royal Academy of Painting which he has just established,
      but there is no salary annexed; and I took it rather as a compliment to
      the institution than any benefit to myself. Honors to one in my situation
      are something like ruffles to one that wants a shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me that there are fourteen or fifteen pounds left me in
      the hands of my cousin Lawder, and you ask me what I would have done with
      them. My dear brother, I would by no means give any directions to my dear
      worthy relations at Kilmore how to dispose of money which is, properly
      speaking, more theirs than mine. All that I can say is, that I entirely,
      and this letter will serve to witness, give up any right and title to it;
      and I am sure they will dispose of it to the best advantage. To them I
      entirely leave it; whether they or you may think the whole necessary to
      fit you out, or whether our poor sister Johnson may not want the half, I
      leave entirely to their and your discretion. The kindness of that good
      couple to our shattered family demands our sincerest gratitude; and though
      they have almost forgotten me, yet, if good things at last arrive, I hope
      one day to return and increase their good-humor, by adding to my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have sent my cousin Jenny a miniature picture of myself, as I
      believe it is the most acceptable present I can offer. I have ordered it
      to be left for her at George Faulkner&rsquo;s, folded in a letter. The
      face, you well know, is ugly enough, but it is finely painted. I will
      shortly also send my friends over the Shannon some mezzotinto prints of
      myself, and some more of my friends here, such as Burke, Johnson,
      Reynolds, and Colman. I believe I have written a hundred letters to
      different friends in your country, and never received an answer to any of
      them. I do not know how to account for this, or why they are unwilling to
      keep up for me those regards which I must ever retain for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If, then, you have a mind to oblige me, you will write often,
      whether I answer you or not. Let me particularly have the news of our
      family and old acquaintances. For instance, you may begin by telling me
      about the family where you reside, how they spend their time, and whether
      they ever make mention of me. Tell me about my mother, my brother Hodson,
      and his son, my brother Harry&rsquo;s son and daughter, my sister Johnson,
      the family of Ballyoughter, what is become of them, where they live, and
      how they do. You talked of being my only brother: I don&rsquo;t understand
      you. Where is Charles? A sheet of paper occasionally filled with the news
      of this kind would make me very happy, and would keep you nearer my mind.
      As it is, my dear brother, believe me to be
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, most affectionately,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      By this letter we find the Goldsmiths the same shifting, shiftless race as
      formerly; a &ldquo;shattered family,&rdquo; scrambling on each other&rsquo;s
      back as soon as any rise above the surface. Maurice is &ldquo;every way
      unprovided for&rdquo;; living upon Cousin Jane and her husband, and,
      perhaps, amusing himself by hunting otter in the river Inny. Sister
      Johnson and her husband are as poorly off as Maurice, with, perhaps, no
      one at hand to quarter themselves upon; as to the rest, &ldquo;what is
      become of them; where do they live; how do they do; what is become of
      Charles?&rdquo; What forlorn, haphazard life is implied by these
      questions! Can we wonder that, with all the love for his native place,
      which is shown throughout Goldsmith&rsquo;s writings, he had not the heart
      to return there? Yet his affections are still there. He wishes to know
      whether the Lawders (which means his cousin Jane, his early Valentine)
      ever make mention of him; he sends Jane his miniature; he believes &ldquo;it
      is the most acceptable present he can offer&rdquo;; he evidently,
      therefore, does not believe she has almost forgotten him, although he
      intimates that he does: in his memory she is still Jane Contarine, as he
      last saw her, when he accompanied her harpsichord with his flute. Absence,
      like death, sets a seal on the image of those we have loved; we cannot
      realize the intervening changes which time may have effected.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the rest of Goldsmith&rsquo;s relatives, he abandons his legacy of
      fifteen pounds, to be shared among them. It is all he has to give. His
      heedless improvidence is eating up the pay of the booksellers in advance.
      With all his literary success, he has neither money nor influence; but he
      has empty fame, and he is ready to participate with them; he is honorary
      professor, without pay; his portrait is to be engraved in mezzotint, in
      company with those of his friends, Burke, Reynolds, Johnson, Colman, and
      others, and he will send prints of them to his friends over the Shannon,
      though they may not have a house to hang them up in. What a motley letter!
      How indicative of the motley character of the writer! By the bye, the
      publication of a splendid mezzotinto engraving of his likeness by
      Reynolds, was a great matter of glorification to Goldsmith, especially as
      it appeared in such illustrious company. As he was one day walking the
      streets in a state of high elation, from having just seen it figuring in
      the print-shop windows, he met a young gentleman with a newly married wife
      hanging on his arm, whom he immediately recognized for Master Bishop, one
      of the boys he had petted and treated with sweetmeats when a humble usher
      at Milner&rsquo;s school. The kindly feelings of old times revived, and he
      accosted him with cordial familiarity, though the youth may have found
      some difficulty in recognizing in the personage, arrayed, perhaps, in
      garments of Tyrian dye, the dingy pedagogue of the Milners. &ldquo;Come,
      my boy,&rdquo; cried Goldsmith, as if still speaking to a schoolboy,
      &ldquo;Come, Sam, I am delighted to see you. I must treat you to something&mdash;what
      shall it be? Will you have some apples?&rdquo; glancing at an old woman&rsquo;s
      stall; then, recollecting the print-shop window: &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;have you seen my picture by Sir Joshua Reynolds? Have you seen
      it, Sam? Have you got an engraving?&rdquo; Bishop was caught; he
      equivocated; he had not yet bought it; but he was furnishing his house,
      and had fixed upon the place where it was to be hung. &ldquo;Ah, Sam!&rdquo;
      rejoined Goldsmith reproachfully, &ldquo;if your picture had been
      published, I should not have waited an hour without having it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, it was honest pride, not vanity, in Goldsmith, that was
      gratified at seeing his portrait deemed worthy of being perpetuated by the
      classic pencil of Reynolds, and &ldquo;hung up in history,&rdquo; beside
      that of his revered friend, Johnson. Even the great moralist himself was
      not insensible to a feeling of this kind. Walking one day with Goldsmith,
      in Westminster Abbey, among the tombs of monarchs, warriors, and
      statesmen, they came to the sculptured mementos of literary worthies in
      Poets&rsquo; Corner. Casting his eye round upon these memorials of genius,
      Johnson muttered in a low tone to his companion,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Goldsmith treasured up the intimated hope, and shortly afterward, as they
      were passing by Temple bar, where the heads of Jacobite rebels, executed
      for treason, were mouldering aloft on spikes, pointed up to the grizzly
      mementos, and echoed the intimation,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur <i>istis</i>.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PUBLICATION OF THE DESERTED VILLAGE&mdash;NOTICES AND ILLUSTRATIONS OF IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Several years had now elapsed since the publication of The Traveler, and
      much wonder was expressed that the great success of that poem had not
      excited the author to further poetic attempts. On being questioned at the
      annual dinner of the Royal Academy by the Earl of Lisburn, why he
      neglected the muses to compile histories and write novels, &ldquo;My Lord,&rdquo;
      replied he, &ldquo;by courting the muses I shall starve, but by my other
      labors I eat, drink, have good clothes, and can enjoy the luxuries of
      life.&rdquo; So, also, on being asked by a poor writer what was the most
      profitable mode of exercising the pen, &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo;
      replied he, good-humoredly, &ldquo;pay no regard to the draggle-tailed
      muses; for my part I have found productions in prose much more sought
      after and better paid for.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, however, as we have heretofore shown, he found sweet moments of
      dalliance to steal away from his prosaic toils, and court the muse among
      the green lanes and hedgerows in the rural environs of London, and on the
      26th of May, 1770, he was enabled to bring his Deserted Village before the
      public.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popularity of The Traveler had prepared the way for this poem, and its
      sale was instantaneous and immense. The first edition was immediately
      exhausted; in a few days a second was issued; in a few days more a third,
      and by the 16th of August the fifth edition was hurried through the press.
      As is the case with popular writers, he had become his own rival, and
      critics were inclined to give the preference to his first poem; but with
      the public at large we believe the Deserted Village has ever been the
      greatest favorite. Previous to its publication the bookseller gave him in
      advance a note for the price agreed upon, one hundred guineas. As the
      latter was returning home he met a friend to whom he mentioned the
      circumstance, and who, apparently judging of poetry by quantity rather
      than quality, observed that it was a great sum for so small a poem.
      &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Goldsmith, &ldquo;I think so too; it is much
      more than the honest man can afford or the piece is worth. I have not been
      easy since I received it.&rdquo; In fact, he actually returned the note to
      the bookseller, and left it to him to graduate the payment according to
      the success of the work. The bookseller, as may well be supposed, soon
      repaid him in full with many acknowledgments of his disinterestedness.
      This anecdote has been called in question, we know not on what grounds; we
      see nothing in it incompatible with the character of Goldsmith, who was
      very impulsive, and prone to acts of inconsiderate generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we do not pretend in this summary memoir to go into a criticism or
      analysis of any of Goldsmith&rsquo;s writings, we shall not dwell upon the
      peculiar merits of this poem; we cannot help noticing, however, how truly
      it is a mirror of the author&rsquo;s heart, and of all the fond pictures
      of early friends and early life forever present there. It seems to us as
      if the very last accounts received from home, of his &ldquo;shattered
      family,&rdquo; and the desolation that seemed to have settled upon the
      haunts of his childhood, had cut to the roots one feebly cherished hope,
      and produced the following exquisitely tender and mournful lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;In all my wand&rsquo;rings round this world of care,
   In all my griefs&mdash;and God has giv&rsquo;n my share&mdash;
   I still had hopes my latest hours to crown,
   Amid these humble bowers to lay me down;
   To husband out life&rsquo;s taper at the close,
   And keep the flame from wasting by repose;
   I still had hopes, for pride attends us still,
   Amid the swains to show my book-learn&rsquo;d skill,
   Around my fire an ev&rsquo;ning group to draw,
   And tell of all I felt and all I saw;
   And as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,
   Pants to the place from whence at first she flew;
   I still had hopes, my long vexations past,
   Here to return&mdash;<i>and die at home at last</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      How touchingly expressive are the succeeding lines, wrung from a heart
      which all the trials and temptations and buffetings of the world could not
      render worldly; which, amid a thousand follies and errors of the head,
      still retained its childlike innocence; and which, doomed to struggle on
      to the last amid the din and turmoil of the metropolis, had ever been
      cheating itself with a dream of rural quiet and seclusion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Oh, bless&rsquo;d retirement! friend to life&rsquo;s decline,
   Retreats from care, <i>that never must be mine</i>,
   How blest is he who crowns, in shades like these,
   A youth of labor with an age of ease;
   Who quits a world where strong temptations try,
   And, since &rsquo;tis hard to combat, learns to fly!
   For him no wretches, born to work and weep,
   Explore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;
   Nor surly porter stands, in guilty state,
   To spurn imploring famine from the gate;
   But on he moves to meet his latter end,
   Angels around befriending virtue&rsquo;s friend;
   Sinks to the grave with unperceived decay,
   While resignation gently slopes the way;
   And all his prospects brightening to the last,
   His heaven commences ere the world be past.&rdquo;

      NOTE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The following article, which appeared in a London periodical, shows the
      effect of Goldsmith&rsquo;s poem in renovating the fortunes of Lissoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three miles from Ballymahon, a very central town in the
      sister kingdom, is the mansion and village of Auburn, so called by their
      present possessor, Captain Hogan. Through the taste and improvement of
      this gentleman, it is now a beautiful spot, although fifteen years since
      it presented a very bare and unpoetical aspect. This, however, was owing
      to a cause which serves strongly to corroborate the assertion that
      Goldsmith had this scene in view when he wrote his poem of The Deserted
      Village. The then possessor, General Napier, turned all his tenants out of
      their farms that he might inclose them in his own private domain.
      Littleton, the mansion of the general, stands not far off, a complete
      emblem of the desolating spirit lamented by the poet, dilapidated and
      converted into a barrack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief object of attraction is Lissoy, once the parsonage house
      of Henry Goldsmith, that brother to whom the poet dedicated his Traveler,
      and who is represented as the village pastor,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Passing rich with forty pounds a year.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was in the country, the lower chambers were inhabited by
      pigs and sheep, and the drawing-rooms by oats. Captain Hogan, however,
      has, I believe, got it since into his possession, and has, of course,
      improved its condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though at first strongly inclined to dispute the identity of
      Auburn, Lissoy House overcame my scruples. As I clambered over the rotten
      gate, and crossed the grass-grown lawn or court, the tide of association
      became too strong for casuistry; here the poet dwelt and wrote, and here
      his thoughts fondly recurred when composing his Traveler in a foreign
      land. Yonder was the decent church, that literally &lsquo;topped the
      neighboring hill.&rsquo; Before me lay the little hill of Knockrue, on
      which he declares, in one of his letters, he had rather sit with a book in
      hand than mingle in the proudest assemblies. And, above all, startlingly
      true, beneath my feet was
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;&lsquo;Yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,
   And still where many a garden-flower grows wild.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A painting from the life could not be more exact. &lsquo;The
      stubborn currant-bush&rsquo; lifts its head above the rank grass, and the
      proud hollyhock flaunts where its sisters of the flower-knot are no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the middle of the village stands the old &lsquo;hawthorn-tree,&rsquo;
      built up with masonry to distinguish and preserve it; it is old and
      stunted, and suffers much from the depredations of post-chaise travelers,
      who generally stop to procure a twig. Opposite to it is the village
      alehouse, over the door of which swings &lsquo;The Three Jolly Pigeons.&rsquo;
      Within everything is arranged according to the letter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The whitewash&rsquo;d wall, the nicely-sanded floor,
   The varnish&rsquo;d clock that click&rsquo;d behind the door:
   The chest, contrived a double debt to pay,
   A bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;
   The pictures placed for ornament and use,
   The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Hogan, I have heard, found great difficulty in obtaining
      &lsquo;the twelve good rules,&rsquo; but at length purchased them at some
      London bookstall to adorn the whitewashed parlor of &lsquo;The Three Jolly
      Pigeons.&rsquo; However laudable this may be, nothing shook my faith in
      the reality of Auburn so much as this exactness, which had the
      disagreeable air of being got up for the occasion. The last object of
      pilgrimage is the quondam habitation of the schoolmaster,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;There, in his noisy mansion, skill&rsquo;d to rule.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is surrounded with fragrant proofs of identity in
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;The blossom&rsquo;d furze, unprofitably gay.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is to be seen the chair of the poet, which fell into the
      hands of its present possessors at the wreck of the parsonage-house; they
      have frequently refused large offers of purchase; but more, I daresay, for
      the sake of drawing contributions from the curious than from any reverence
      for the bard. The chair is of oak, with back and seat of cane, which
      precluded all hopes of a secret drawer, like that lately discovered in Gay&rsquo;s.
      There is no fear of its being worn out by the devout earnestness of
      sitters&mdash;as the cocks and hens have usurped undisputed possession of
      it, and protest most clamorously against all attempts to get it cleansed
      or to seat one&rsquo;s self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The controversy concerning the identity of this Auburn was formerly
      a standing theme of discussion among the learned of the neighborhood; but,
      since the pros and cons have been all ascertained, the argument has died
      away. Its abettors plead the singular agreement between the local history
      of the place and the Auburn of the poem, and the exactness with which the
      scenery of the one answers to the description of the other. To this is
      opposed the mention of the nightingale,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;And fill&rsquo;d each pause the nightingale had made&rsquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      there being no such bird in the island. The objection is slighted, on the
      other hand, by considering the passage as a mere poetical license. &lsquo;Besides,&rsquo;
      say they, &lsquo;the robin is the Irish nightingale.&rsquo; And if it be
      hinted how unlikely it was that Goldsmith should have laid the scene in a
      place from which he was and had been so long absent, the rejoinder is
      always, &lsquo;Pray, sir, was Milton in hell when he built Pandemonium?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The line is naturally drawn between; there can be no doubt that the
      poet intended England by
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;The land to hast&rsquo;ning ills a prey,
    Where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is very natural to suppose that, at the same time, his
      imagination had in view the scenes of his youth, which give such strong
      features of resemblance to the picture.&rdquo;

      Best, an Irish clergyman, told Davis, the traveler in America, that the
      hawthorn-bush mentioned in the poem was still remarkably large. &ldquo;I
      was riding once,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with Brady, titular Bishop of
      Ardagh, when he observed to me, &lsquo;Ma foy, Best, this huge overgrown
      bush is mightily in the way. I will order it to be cut down.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;What, sir!&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;cut down the bush that supplies
      so beautiful an image in The Deserted Village?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Ma foy!&rsquo;
      exclaimed the bishop, &lsquo;is that the hawthorn-bush? Then let it be
      sacred from the edge of the ax, and evil be to him that should cut off a
      branch.&rsquo; &ldquo;&mdash;The hawthorn-bush, however, has long since
      been cut up, root and branch, in furnishing relics to literary pilgrims.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE POET AMONG THE LADIES&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF HIS PERSON AND MANNERS&mdash;EXPEDITION
      TO PARIS WITH THE HORNECK FAMILY&mdash;THE TRAVELER OF TWENTY AND THE
      TRAVELER OF FORTY&mdash;HICKEY, THE SPECIAL ATTORNEY&mdash;AN UNLUCKY
      EXPLOIT
    </p>
    <p>
      The Deserted Village had shed an additional poetic grace round the homely
      person of the author; he was becoming more and more acceptable in ladies&rsquo;
      eyes, and finding himself more and more at ease in their society; at least
      in the society of those whom he met in the Reynolds circle, among whom he
      particularly affected the beautiful family of the Hornecks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us see what were really the looks and manners of Goldsmith about
      this time, and what right he had to aspire to ladies&rsquo; smiles; and in
      so doing let us not take the sketches of Boswell and his compeers, who had
      a propensity to represent him in caricature; but let us take the
      apparently truthful and discriminating picture of him as he appeared to
      Judge Day, when the latter was a student in the Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In person,&rdquo; says the judge, &ldquo;he was short; about five
      feet five or six inches; strong, but not heavy in make; rather fair in
      complexion, with brown hair; such, at least, as could be distinguished
      from his wig. His features were plain, but not repulsive&mdash;certainly
      not so when lighted up by conversation. His manners were simple, natural,
      and perhaps on the whole, we may say, not polished; at least without the
      refinement and good-breeding which the exquisite polish of his
      compositions would lead us to expect. He was always cheerful and animated,
      often, indeed, boisterous in his mirth; entered with spirit into convivial
      society; contributed largely to its enjoyments by solidity of information,
      and the naïvete and originality of his character; talked often without
      premeditation, and laughed loudly without restraint.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This, it will be recollected, represents him as he appeared to a young
      Templar, who probably saw him only in Temple coffee-houses, at students&rsquo;
      quarters, or at the jovial supper parties given at the poet&rsquo;s own
      chambers; here, of course, his mind was in its rough dress; his laugh may
      have been loud and his mirth boisterous; but we trust all these matters
      became softened and modified when he found himself in polite drawing-rooms
      and in female society.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what say the ladies themselves of him; and here, fortunately, we have
      another sketch of him, as he appeared at the time to one of the Horneck
      circle; in fact, we believe, to the Jessamy Bride herself. After
      admitting, apparently with some reluctance, that &ldquo;he was a very
      plain man,&rdquo; she goes on to say, &ldquo;but had he been much more so,
      it was impossible not to love and respect his goodness of heart, which
      broke out on every occasion. His benevolence was unquestionable, and <i>his
      countenance bore every trace of it</i>: no one that knew him intimately
      could avoid admiring and loving his good qualities.&rdquo; When to all
      this we add the idea of intellectual delicacy and refinement associated
      with him by his poetry and the newly plucked bays that were flourishing
      round his brow, we cannot be surprised that fine and fashionable ladies
      should be proud of his attentions, and that even a young beauty should not
      be altogether displeased with the thoughts of having a man of his genius
      in her chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are led to indulge some notions of the kind from finding him in the
      month of July, but a few weeks after the publication of the Deserted
      Village, setting off on a six weeks&rsquo; excursion to Paris, in company
      with Mrs. Horneck and her two beautiful daughters. A day or two before his
      departure we find another new gala suit charged to him on the books of Mr.
      William Filby. Were the bright eyes of the Jessamy Bride responsible for
      this additional extravagance of wardrobe? Goldsmith had recently been
      editing the works of Parnell; had he taken courage from the example of
      Edwin in the fairy tale?&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Yet spite of all that nature did
  To make his uncouth form forbid,
    This creature dared to love.
  He felt the force of Edith&rsquo;s eyes,
  Nor wanted hope to gain the prize
    <i>Could ladies look within&mdash;</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All this we throw out as mere hints and surmises, leaving it to our
      readers to draw their own conclusions. It will be found, however, that the
      poet was subjected to shrewd bantering among his contemporaries about the
      beautiful Mary Horneck, and that he was extremely sensitive on the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the month of June that he set out for Paris with his fair
      companions, and the following letter was written by him to Sir Joshua
      Reynolds, soon after the party landed at Calais:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRIEND&mdash;We had a very quick passage from Dover to
      Calais, which we performed in three hours and twenty minutes, all of us
      extremely seasick, which must necessarily have happened, as my machine to
      prevent seasickness was not completed. We were glad to leave Dover,
      because we hated to be imposed upon; so were in high spirits at coming to
      Calais, where we were told that a little money would go a great way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon landing, with two little trunks, which was all we carried with
      us, we were surprised to see fourteen or fifteen fellows all running down
      to the ship to lay their hands upon them; four got under each trunk, the
      rest surrounded and held the hasps; and in this manner our little baggage
      was conducted, with a kind of funeral solemnity, till it was safely lodged
      at the custom-house. We were well enough pleased with the people&rsquo;s
      civility till they came to be paid; every creature that had the happiness
      of but touching our trunks with their finger expected sixpence; and they
      had so pretty and civil a manner of demanding it that there was no
      refusing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we had done with the porters, we had next to speak with the
      custom-house officers, who had their pretty civil ways too. We were
      directed to the Hotel d&rsquo;Angleterre, where a valet-de-place came to
      offer his service, and spoke to me ten minutes before I once found out
      that he was speaking English. We had no occasion for his services, so we
      gave him a little money because he spoke English, and because he wanted
      it. I cannot help mentioning another circumstance: I bought a new ribbon
      for my wig at Canterbury, and the barber at Calais broke it in order to
      gain sixpence by buying me a new one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An incident which occurred in the course of this tour has been tortured by
      that literary magpie, Boswell, into a proof of Goldsmith&rsquo;s absurd
      jealousy of any admiration shown to others in his presence. While stopping
      at a hotel in Lisle, they were drawn to the windows by a military parade
      in front. The extreme beauty of the Misses Horneck immediately attracted
      the attention of the officers, who broke forth with enthusiastic speeches
      and compliments intended for their ears. Goldsmith was amused for a while,
      but at length affected impatience at this exclusive admiration of his
      beautiful companions, and exclaimed, with mock severity of aspect, &ldquo;Elsewhere
      I also would have my admirers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to conceive the obtuseness of intellect necessary to
      misconstrue so obvious a piece of mock petulance and dry humor into an
      instance of mortified vanity and jealous self-conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith jealous of the admiration of a group of gay officers for the
      charms of two beautiful young women! This even out-Boswells Boswell; yet
      this is but one of several similar absurdities, evidently misconceptions
      of Goldsmith&rsquo;s peculiar vein of humor, by which the charge of
      envious jealousy has been attempted to be fixed upon him. In the present
      instance it was contradicted by one of the ladies herself, who was annoyed
      that it had been advanced against him. &ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;from the peculiar manner of his humor, and assumed frown of
      countenance, what was often uttered in jest was mistaken, by those who did
      not know him, for earnest.&rdquo; No one was more prone to err on this
      point than Boswell. He had a tolerable perception of wit, but none of
      humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following letter to Sir Joshua Reynolds was subsequently written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To <i>Sir Joshua Reynolds</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PARIS, <i>July 29 (1770)</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR FRIEND&mdash;I began a long letter to you from Lisle,
      giving a description of all that we had done and seen, but, finding it
      very dull, and knowing that you would show it again, I threw it aside and
      it was lost. You see by the top of this letter that we are at Paris, and
      (as I have often heard you say) we have brought our own amusement with us,
      for the ladies do not seem to be very fond of what we have yet seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With regard to myself, I find that traveling at twenty and forty
      are very different things. I set out with all my confirmed habits about
      me, and can find nothing on the Continent so good as when I formerly left
      it. One of our chief amusements here is scolding at everything we meet
      with, and praising everything and every person we left at home. You may
      judge, therefore, whether your name is not frequently bandied at table
      among us. To tell you the truth, I never thought I could regret your
      absence so much as our various mortifications on the road have often
      taught me to do. I could tell you of disasters and adventures without
      number; of our lying in barns, and of my being half poisoned with a dish
      of green peas; of our quarreling with postilions, and being cheated by our
      landladies; but I reserve all this for a happy hour which I expect to
      share with you upon my return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have little to tell you more but that we are at present all well,
      and expect returning when we have stayed out one month, which I did not
      care if it were over this very day. I long to hear from you all, how you
      yourself do, how Johnson, Burke, Dyer, Chamier, Colman, and every one of
      the club do. I wish I could send you some amusement in this letter, but I
      protest I am so stupefied by the air of this country (for I am sure it
      cannot be natural) that I have not a word to say. I have been thinking of
      the plot of a comedy, which shall be entitled A Journey to Paris, in which
      a family shall be introduced with a full intention of going to France to
      save money. You know there is not a place in the world more promising for
      that purpose. As for the meat of this country, I can scarce eat it; and,
      though we pay two good shillings a head for our dinner, I find it all so
      tough that I have spent less time with my knife than my picktooth. I said
      this as a good thing at the table, but it was not understood. I believe it
      to be a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for our intended journey to Devonshire, I find it out of my
      power to perform it; for, as soon as I arrive at Dover, I intend to let
      the ladies go on, and I will take a country lodging somewhere near that
      place in order to do some business. I have so outrun the constable that I
      must mortify a little to bring it up again. For God&rsquo;s sake, the
      night you receive this, take your pen in your hand and tell me something
      about yourself and myself, if you know anything that has happened. About
      Miss Reynolds, about Mr. Bickerstaff, my nephew, or anybody that you
      regard. I beg you will send to Griffin the bookseller to know if there be
      any letters left for me, and be so good as to send them to me at Paris.
      They may perhaps be left for me at the Porter&rsquo;s Lodge, opposite the
      pump in Temple Lane. The same messenger will do. I expect one from Lord
      Clare, from Ireland. As for the others, I am not much uneasy about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you at Paris? I wish you would tell
      me. The whole of my own purchases here is one silk coat, which I have put
      on, and which makes me look like a fool. But no more of that. I find that
      Colman has gained his lawsuit. I am glad of it. I suppose you often meet.
      I will soon be among you, better pleased with my situation at home than I
      ever was before. And yet I must say that, if anything could make France
      pleasant, the very good women with whom I am at present would certainly do
      it. I could say more about that, but I intend showing them the letter
      before I send it away. What signifies teasing you longer with moral
      observations, when the business of my writing is over? I have one thing
      only more to say, and of that I think every hour in the day; namely, that
      I am your most sincere and most affectionate friend,

    <p>
      A word of comment on this letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      Traveling is, indeed, a very different thing with Goldsmith the poor
      student at twenty, and Goldsmith the poet and professor at forty. At
      twenty, though obliged to trudge on foot from town to town, and country to
      country, paying for a supper and a bed by a tune on the flute, everything
      pleased, everything was good; a truckle bed in a garret was a conch of
      down, and the homely fare of the peasant a feast fit for an epicure. Now,
      at forty, when he posts through the country in a carriage, with fair
      ladies by his side, everything goes wrong: he has to quarrel with
      postilions, he is cheated by landladies, the hotels are barns, the meat is
      too tough to be eaten, and he is half poisoned by green peas! A line hi
      his letter explains the secret: &ldquo;The ladies do not seem to be very
      fond of what we have yet seen.&rdquo; &ldquo;One of our chief amusements
      is scolding at everything we meet with, and praising everything and every
      person we have left at home!&rdquo; the true English traveling amusement.
      Poor Goldsmith! he has &ldquo;all his <i>confirmed</i> habits about him&rdquo;;
      that is to say, he has recently risen into high life, and acquired
      highbred notions; he must be fastidious like his fellow-travelers; he dare
      not be pleased with what pleased the vulgar tastes of his youth. He is
      unconsciously illustrating the trait so humorously satirized by him in
      Bill Tibbs, the shabby beau, who can find &ldquo;no such dressing as he
      had at Lord Crump&rsquo;s or Lady Crimp&rsquo;s&rdquo;; whose very senses
      have grown genteel, and who no longer &ldquo;smacks at wretched wine or
      praises detestable custard.&rdquo; A lurking thorn, too, is worrying him
      throughout this tour; he has &ldquo;outrun the constable&rdquo;; that is
      to say, his expenses have outrun his means, and he will have to make up
      for this butterfly flight by toiling like a grub on his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another circumstance contributes to mar the pleasure he had promised
      himself in this excursion. At Paris the party is unexpectedly joined by a
      Mr. Hickey, a bustling attorney, who is well acquainted with that
      metropolis and its environs, and insists on playing the cicerone on all
      occasions. He and Goldsmith do not relish each other, and they have
      several petty altercations. The lawyer is too much a man of business and
      method for the careless poet, and is disposed to manage everything. He has
      perceived Goldsmith&rsquo;s whimsical peculiarities without properly
      appreciating his merits, and is prone to indulge in broad bantering and
      raillery at his expense, particularly irksome if indulged in presence of
      the ladies. He makes himself merry on his return to England, by giving the
      following anecdote as illustrative of Goldsmith&rsquo;s vanity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being with a party at Versailles, viewing the waterworks, a
      question arose among the gentlemen present, whether the distance from
      whence they stood to one of the little islands was within the compass of a
      leap. Goldsmith maintained the affirmative; but, being bantered on the
      subject, and remembering his former prowess as a youth, attempted the
      leap, but, falling short, descended into the water, to the great amusement
      of the company.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the Jessamy Bride a witness of this unlucky exploit?
    </p>
    <p>
      This same Hickey is the one of whom Goldsmith, some time subsequently,
      gave a good-humored sketch in his poem of The Retaliation.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here Hickey reclines, a most blunt, pleasant creature,
  And slander itself must allow him good nature;
  He cherish&rsquo;d his friend, and he relish&rsquo;d a bumper,
  Yet one fault he had, and that one was a thumper.
  Perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser;
  I answer No, no, for he always was wiser;
  Too courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat,
  His very worst foe can&rsquo;t accuse him of that;
  Perhaps he confided in men as they go,
  And so was too foolishly honest? Ah, not
  Then what was his failing? Come, tell it, and burn ye&mdash;
  He was, could he help it? a special attorney.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      One of the few remarks extant made by Goldsmith during his tour is the
      following, of whimsical import, in his Animated Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In going through the towns of France, some time since, I could not
      help observing how much plainer their parrots spoke than ours, and how
      very distinctly I understood their parrots speak French, when I could not
      understand our own, though they spoke my native language. I at first
      ascribed it to the different qualities of the two languages, and was for
      entering into an elaborate discussion on the vowels and consonants; but a
      friend that was with me solved the difficulty at once, by assuring me that
      the French women scarce did anything else the whole day than sit and
      instruct their feathered pupils; and that the birds were thus distinct in
      their lessons in consequence of continual schooling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His tour does not seem to have left in his memory the most fragrant
      recollections; for, being asked, after his return, whether traveling on
      the Continent repaid &ldquo;an Englishman for the privations and
      annoyances attendant on it,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I recommend it by
      all means to the sick, if they are without the sense of <i>smelling</i>,
      and to the poor, if they are without the sense of <i>feeling</i>; and to
      both, if they can discharge from their minds all idea of what in England
      we term comfort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that the universal improvement in the art of living
      on the Continent has at the present day taken away the force of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      reply, though even at the time it was more humorous than correct.

      CHAPTER THIRTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      DEATH OF GOLDSMITH&rsquo;S MOTHER&mdash;BIOGRAPHY OF PARNELL&mdash;AGREEMENT
      WITH DAVIES FOR THE HISTORY OF ROME&mdash;LIFE OP BOLINGBROKE&mdash;THE
      HAUNCH OF VENISON
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to England, Goldsmith received the melancholy tidings of the
      death of his mother. Notwithstanding the fame as an author to which he had
      attained, she seems to have been disappointed in her early expectations
      from him. Like others of his family, she had been more vexed by his early
      follies than pleased by his proofs of genius; and in subsequent years,
      when he had risen to fame and to intercourse with the great, had been
      annoyed at the ignorance of the world and want of management, which
      prevented him from pushing his fortune. He had always, however, been an
      affectionate son, and in the latter years of her life, when she had become
      blind, contributed from his precarious resources to prevent her from
      feeling want.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now resumed the labors of the pen, which his recent excursion to Paris
      rendered doubly necessary. We should have mentioned a Life of Parnell,
      published by him shortly after the Deserted Village. It was, as usual, a
      piece of job work, hastily got up for pocket-money. Johnson spoke
      slightingly of it, and the author, himself, thought proper to apologize
      for its meagerness; yet, in so doing, used a simile which for beauty of
      imagery and felicity of language is enough of itself to stamp a value upon
      the essay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the very unpoetical detail of the
      life of a poet. Some dates and some few facts, scarcely more interesting
      than those that make the ornaments of a country tombstone, are all that
      remain of one whose labors now begin to excite universal curiosity. A
      poet, while living, is seldom an object sufficiently great to attract much
      attention; his real merits are known but to a few, and these are generally
      sparing in their praises. When his fame is increased by time, it is then
      too late to investigate the peculiarities of his disposition; <i>the dews
      of morning are past, and we vainly try to continue the chase by the
      meridian splendor</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He now entered into an agreement with Davies to prepare an abridgment, in
      one volume duodecimo, of his History of Rome; but first to write a work
      for which there was a more immediate demand. Davies was about to republish
      Lord Bolingbroke&rsquo;s Dissertation on Parties, which he conceived would
      be exceedingly applicable to the affairs of the day, and make a probable
      <i>hit</i> during the existing state of violent political excitement; to
      give it still greater effect and currency he engaged Goldsmith to
      introduce it with a prefatory life of Lord Bolingbroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time Goldsmith&rsquo;s friend and countryman, Lord Clare, was
      in great affliction, caused by the death of his only son, Colonel Nugent,
      and stood in need of the sympathies of a kind-hearted friend. At his
      request, therefore, Goldsmith paid him a visit at his noble seat of
      Gosford, taking his tasks with him. Davies was in a worry lest Gosford
      Park should prove a Capua to the poet, and the time be lost. &ldquo;Dr.
      Goldsmith,&rdquo; writes he to a friend, &ldquo;has gone with Lord Clare
      into the country, and I am plagued to get the proofs from him of the Life
      of Lord Bolingbroke.&rdquo; The proofs, however, were furnished in time
      for the publication of the work in December. The Biography, though written
      during a time of political turmoil, and introducing a work intended to be
      thrown into the arena of politics, maintained that freedom from party
      prejudice observable in all the writings of Goldsmith. It was a selection
      of facts drawn from many unreadable sources, and arranged into a clear,
      flowing narrative, illustrative of the career and character of one who, as
      he intimates, &ldquo;seemed formed by nature to take delight in struggling
      with opposition; whose most agreeable hours were passed in storms of his
      own creating; whose life was spent in a continual conflict of politics,
      and as if that was too short for the combat, has left his memory as a
      subject of lasting contention.&rdquo; The sum received by the author for
      this memoir is supposed, from circumstances, to have been forty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith did not find the residence among the great unattended with
      mortifications. He had now become accustomed to be regarded in London as a
      literary lion, and was annoyed at what he considered a slight on the part
      of Lord Camden. He complained of it on his return to town at a party of
      his friends. &ldquo;I met him,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at Lord Clare&rsquo;s
      house in the country; and he took no more notice of me than if I had been
      an ordinary man.&rdquo; &ldquo;The company,&rdquo; says Boswell, &ldquo;laughed
      heartily at this piece of &lsquo;diverting simplicity.&rsquo;&rdquo; And
      foremost among the laughters was doubtless the rattle-pated Boswell.
      Johnson, however, stepped forward, as usual, to defend the poet, whom he
      would allow no one to assail but himself; perhaps in the present instance
      he thought the dignity of literature itself involved in the question.
      &ldquo;Nay, gentlemen,&rdquo; roared he, &ldquo;Dr. Goldsmith is in the
      right. A nobleman ought to have made up to such a man as Goldsmith, and I
      think it is much against Lord Camden that he neglected him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After Goldsmith&rsquo;s return to town he received from Lord Clare a
      present of game, which he has celebrated and perpetuated in his amusing
      verses entitled the Haunch of Venison. Some of the lines pleasantly set
      forth the embarrassment caused by the appearance of such an aristocratic
      delicacy in the humble kitchen of a poet, accustomed to look up to mutton
      as a treat:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Thanks, my lord, for your venison; for finer or fatter
  Never rang&rsquo;d in a forest, or smok&rsquo;d in a platter:
  The haunch was a picture for painters to study,
  The fat was so white, and the lean was so ruddy;
  Though my stomach was sharp, I could scarce help regretting,
  To spoil such a delicate picture by eating:
  I had thought in my chambers to place it in view,
  To be shown to my friends as a piece of virtu;
  As in some Irish houses where things are so-so,
  One gammon of bacon hangs up for a show;
  But, for eating a rasher, of what they take pride in,
  They&rsquo;d as soon think of eating the pan it was fry&rsquo;d in.

       *       *       *       *       *       *       *

 &ldquo;But hang it&mdash;to poets, who seldom can eat,
  Your very good mutton&rsquo;s a very good treat;
  Such dainties to them, their health it might hurt;
  <i>It&rsquo;s like sending them ruffles, when wanting a shirt.</i>&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      We have an amusing anecdote of one of Goldsmith&rsquo;s blunders which
      took place on a subsequent visit to Lord Clare&rsquo;s, when that nobleman
      was residing in Bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Clare and the Duke of Northumberland had houses next to each other,
      of similar architecture. Returning home one morning from an early walk,
      Goldsmith, in one of his frequent fits of absence, mistook the house, and
      walked up into the duke&rsquo;s dining-room, where he and the duchess were
      about to sit down to breakfast. Goldsmith, still supposing himself in the
      house of Lord Clare, and that they were visitors, made them an easy
      salutation, being acquainted with, them, and threw himself on a sofa in
      the lounging manner of a man perfectly at home. The duke and duchess soon
      perceived his mistake, and, while they smiled internally, endeavored, with
      the considerateness of well-bred people, to prevent any awkward
      embarrassment. They accordingly chatted sociably with him about matters in
      Bath, until, breakfast being served, they invited him to partake. The
      truth at once flashed upon poor heedless Goldsmith; he started up from the
      free-and-easy position, made a confused apology for his blunder, and would
      have retired perfectly disconcerted, had not the duke and duchess treated
      the whole as a lucky occurrence to throw him in their way, and exacted a
      promise from him to dine with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may be hung up as a companion-piece to his blunder on his first visit
      to Northumberland House.

    <p>
      DINNER AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY&mdash;THE ROWLEY CONTROVERSY&mdash;HORACE
      WALPOLE&rsquo;S CONDUCT TO CHATTERTON&mdash;JOHNSON AT REDCLIFFE CHURCH&mdash;GOLDSMITH&rsquo;S
      HISTORY OF ENGLAND&mdash;DAVIES&rsquo; CRITICISM&mdash;LETTER TO BENNET
      LANGTON
    </p>
    <p>
      On St. George&rsquo;s day of this year (1771), the first annual banquet of
      the Royal Academy was held in the exhibition room; the walls of which were
      covered with works of art, about to be submitted to public inspection. Sir
      Joshua Reynolds, who first suggested this elegant festival, presided in
      his official character; Drs. Johnson and Goldsmith, of course, were
      present, as professors of the academy; and, besides the academicians,
      there was a large number of the most distinguished men of the day as
      guests. Goldsmith on this occasion drew on himself the attention of the
      company by launching out with enthusiasm on the poems recently given to
      the world by Chatterton as the works of an ancient author by the name of
      Rowley, discovered in the tower of Redcliffe Church, at Bristol. Goldsmith
      spoke of them with rapture, as a treasure of old English poetry. This
      immediately raised the question of their authenticity; they having been
      pronounced a forgery of Chatterton&rsquo;s. Goldsmith was warm for their
      being genuine. When he considered, he said, the merit of the poetry; the
      acquaintance with life and the human heart displayed in them, the antique
      quaintness of the language and the familiar knowledge of historical events
      of their supposed day, he could not believe it possible they could be the
      work of a boy of sixteen, of narrow education, and confined to the duties
      of an attorney&rsquo;s office. They must be the productions of Rowley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson, who was a stout unbeliever in Rowley, as he had been in Ossian,
      rolled in his chair and laughed at the enthusiasm of Goldsmith. Horace
      Walpole, who sat near by, joined in the laugh and jeer as soon as he found
      that the &ldquo;<i>trouvaille</i>,&rdquo; as he called it, &ldquo;of <i>his
      friend</i> Chatterton&rdquo; was in question. This matter, which had
      excited the simple admiration of Goldsmith, was no novelty to him, he
      said. &ldquo;He might, had he pleased, have had the honor of ushering the
      great discovery to the learned world.&rdquo; And so he might, had he
      followed his first impulse in the matter, for he himself had been an
      original believer; had pronounced some specimen verses sent to him by
      Chatterton wonderful for their harmony and spirit; and had been ready to
      print them and publish them to the world with his sanction. When he found,
      however, that his unknown correspondent was a mere boy, humble in sphere
      and indigent in circumstances, and when Gray and Mason pronounced the
      poems forgeries, he had changed his whole conduct toward the unfortunate
      author, and by his neglect and coldness had dashed all his sanguine hopes
      to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exulting in his superior discernment, this cold-hearted man of society now
      went on to divert himself, as he says, with the credulity of Goldsmith,
      whom he was accustomed to pronounce &ldquo;an inspired idiot&rdquo;; but
      his mirth was soon dashed, for on asking the poet what had become of this
      Chatterton, he was answered, doubtless in the feeling tone of one who had
      experienced the pangs of despondent genius, that &ldquo;he had been to
      London and had destroyed himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply struck a pang of self-reproach even to the cold heart of
      Walpole; a faint blush may have visited his cheek at his recent levity.
      &ldquo;The persons of honor and veracity who were present,&rdquo; said he
      in after years, when he found it necessary to exculpate himself from the
      charge of heartless neglect of genius, &ldquo;will attest with what
      surprise and concern. I thus first heard of his death.&rdquo; Well might
      he feel concern. His cold neglect had doubtless contributed to madden the
      spirit of that youthful genius, and hurry him toward his untimely end; nor
      have all the excuses and palliations of Walpole&rsquo;s friends and
      admirers been ever able entirely to clear this stigma from his fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was there in the enthusiasm and credulity of honest Goldsmith in
      this matter to subject him to the laugh of Johnson or the raillery of
      Walpole? Granting the poems were not ancient, were they not good? Granting
      they were not the productions of Rowley, were they the less admirable for
      being the productions of Chatterton? Johnson himself testified to their
      merits and the genius of their composer when, some years afterward, he
      visited the tower of Redcliffe Church, and was shown the coffer in which
      poor Chatterton had pretended to find them. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;is the most extraordinary young man that has encountered my
      knowledge. <i>It is wonderful how the whelp has written such things</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Goldsmith, he persisted in his credulity, and had subsequently a
      dispute with Dr. Percy on the subject, which interrupted and almost
      destroyed their friendship. After all, his enthusiasm was of a generous,
      poetic kind; the poems remain beautiful monuments of genius, and it is
      even now difficult to persuade one&rsquo;s self that they could be
      entirely the productions of a youth of sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the month of August was published anonymously the History of England,
      on which Goldsmith had been for some time employed. It was in four
      volumes, compiled chiefly, as he acknowledged in the preface, from Rapin,
      Carle, Smollett and Hume, &ldquo;each of whom,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;have
      their admirers, in proportion as the reader is studious of political
      antiquities, fond of minute anecdote, a warm partisan, or a deliberate
      reasoner.&rdquo; It possessed the same kind of merit as his other
      historical compilations; a clear, succinct narrative, a simple, easy, and
      graceful style, and an agreeable arrangement of facts; but was not
      remarkable for either depth of observation or minute accuracy of research.
      Many passages were transferred, with little if any alteration, from his
      Letters from a Nobleman to his Son on the same subject. The work, though
      written without party feeling, met with sharp animadversions from
      political scribblers. The writer was charged with being unfriendly to
      liberty, disposed to elevate monarchy above its proper sphere; a tool of
      ministers; one who would betray his country for a pension. Tom Davies, the
      publisher, the pompous little bibliopole of Russell Street, alarmed lest
      the book should prove unsalable, undertook to protect it by his pen, and
      wrote a long article in its defense in &ldquo;The Public Advertiser.&rdquo;
      He was vain of his critical effusion, and sought by nods and winks and
      innuendoes to intimate his authorship. &ldquo;Have you seen,&rdquo; said
      he in a letter to a friend, &ldquo;&lsquo;An Impartial Account of
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s History of England&rsquo;? If you want to know who was
      the writer of it, you will find him in Russell Street&mdash;<i>but mum</i>!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The history, on the whole, however, was well received; some of the critics
      declared that English history had never before been so usefully, so
      elegantly, and agreeably epitomized, &ldquo;and, like his other historical
      writings, it has kept its ground&rdquo; in English literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith had intended this summer, in company with Sir Joshua Reynolds,
      to pay a visit to Bennet Langton, at his seat in Lincolnshire, where he
      was settled in domestic life, having the year previously married the
      Countess Dowager of Rothes. The following letter, however, dated from his
      chambers in the Temple, on the 7th of September, apologizes for putting
      off the visit, while it gives an amusing account of his summer occupations
      and of the attacks of the critics on his History of England:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR SIR&mdash;Since I had the pleasure of seeing you last, I
      have been almost wholly in the country, at a farmer&rsquo;s house, quite
      alone, trying to write a comedy. It is now finished; but when or how it
      will be acted, or whether it will be acted at all, are questions I cannot
      resolve. I am therefore so much employed upon that, that I am under the
      necessity of putting off my intended visit to Lincolnshire for this
      season. Reynolds is just returned from Paris, and finds himself now in the
      case of a truant that must make up for his idle time by diligence. We have
      therefore agreed to postpone our journey till next summer, when we hope to
      have the honor of waiting upon Lady Rothes and you, and staying double the
      time of our late intended visit. We often meet, and never without
      remembering you. I see Mr. Beauclerc very often both in town and country.
      He is now going directly forward to become a second Boyle; deep in
      chemistry and physics. Johnson has been down on a visit to a country
      parson, Dr. Taylor; and is returned to his old haunts at Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s.
      Burke is a farmer, <i>en attendant</i> a better place; but visiting about
      too. Every soul is visiting about and merry but myself. And that is hard
      too, as I have been trying these three months to do something to make
      people laugh. There have I been strolling about the hedges, studying jests
      with a most tragical countenance. The Natural History is about half
      finished, and I will shortly finish the rest. God knows I am tired of this
      kind of finishing, which is but bungling work; and that not so much my
      fault as the fault of my scurvy circumstances. They begin to talk in town
      of the Opposition&rsquo;s gaining ground; the cry of liberty is still as
      loud as ever. I have published, or Davies has published for me, an &lsquo;Abridgment
      of the History of England,&rsquo; for which I have been a good deal abused
      in the newspapers, for betraying the liberties of the people. God knows I
      had no thought for or against liberty in my head; my whole aim being to
      make up a book of a decent size, that, as &lsquo;Squire Richard says, <i>would
      do no harm to nobody</i>. However, they set me down as an arrant Tory, and
      consequently an honest man. When you come to look at any part of it, you&rsquo;ll
      say that I am a sore Whig. God bless you, and with my most respectful
      compliments to her ladyship, I remain, dear sir, your most affectionate
      humble servant,

      CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      MARRIAGE OF LITTLE COMEDY&mdash;GOLDSMITH AT BARTON&mdash;PRACTICAL JOKES
      AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS TOILET&mdash;AMUSEMENTS AT BARTON&mdash;AQUATIC
      MISADVENTURE
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Goldsmith found it impossible to break from his literary
      occupations to visit Bennet Langton, in Lincolnshire, he soon yielded to
      attractions from another quarter, in which somewhat of sentiment may have
      mingled. Miss Catharine Horneck, one of his beautiful fellow-travelers,
      otherwise called &ldquo;Little Comedy,&rdquo; had been married in August
      to Henry William Bunbury, Esq., a gentleman of fortune, who has become
      celebrated for the humorous productions of his pencil. Goldsmith was
      shortly afterward invited to pay the newly married couple a visit at their
      seat, at Barton, in Suffolk. How could he resist such an invitation&mdash;especially
      as the Jessamy Bride would, of course, be among the guests? It is true, he
      was hampered with work; he was still more hampered with debt; his accounts
      with Newbery were perplexed; but all must give way. New advances are
      procured from Newbery, on the promise of a new tale in the style of the
      Vicar of Wakefield, of which he showed him a few roughly-sketched
      chapters; so, his purse replenished in the old way, &ldquo;by hook or by
      crook,&rdquo; he posted off to visit the bride at Barton. He found there a
      joyous household, and one where he was welcomed with affection. Garrick
      was there, and played the part of master of the revels, for he was an
      intimate friend of the master of the house. Notwithstanding early
      misunderstandings, a social intercourse between the actor and the poet had
      grown up of late, from meeting together continually in the same circle. A
      few particulars have reached us concerning Goldsmith while on this happy
      visit. We believe the legend has come down from Miss Mary Horneck herself.
      &ldquo;While at Barton,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;his manners were always
      playful and amusing, taking the lead in promoting any scheme of innocent
      mirth, and usually prefacing the invitation with &lsquo;Come, now, let us
      play the fool a little.&rsquo; At cards, which was commonly a round game,
      and the stake small, he was always the most noisy, affected great
      eagerness to win, and teased his opponents of the gentler sex with
      continual jest and banter on their want of spirit in not risking the
      hazards of the game. But one of his most favorite enjoyments was to romp
      with the children, when he threw off all reserve, and seemed one of the
      most joyous of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the means by which he amused us was his songs, chiefly of
      the comic kind, which were sung with some taste and humor; several, I
      believe, were of his own composition, and I regret that I neither have
      copies, which might have been readily procured from him at the time, nor
      do I remember their names.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His perfect good humor made him the object of tricks of all kinds; often
      in retaliation of some prank which he himself had played off. Unluckily
      these tricks were sometimes made at the expense of his toilet, which, with
      a view peradventure to please the eye of a certain fair lady, he had again
      enriched to the impoverishment of his purse. &ldquo;Being at all times gay
      in his dress,&rdquo; says this ladylike legend, &ldquo;he made his
      appearance at the breakfast-table in a smart black silk coat with an
      expensive pair of ruffles; the coat some one contrived to soil, and it was
      sent to be cleansed; but, either by accident, or probably by design, the
      day after it came home, the sleeves became daubed with paint, which was
      not discovered until the ruffles also, to his great mortification, were
      irretrievably disfigured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always wore a wig, a peculiarity which those who judge of his
      appearance only from the fine poetical head of Reynolds would not suspect;
      and on one occasion some person contrived seriously to injure this
      important adjunct to dress. It was the only one he had in the country, and
      the misfortune seemed irreparable until the services of Mr. Bunbury&rsquo;s
      valet were called in, who, however, performed his functions so
      indifferently that poor Goldsmith&rsquo;s appearance became the signal for
      a general smile.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was wicked waggery, especially when it was directed to mar all the
      attempts of the unfortunate poet to improve his personal appearance, about
      which he was at all times dubiously sensitive, and particularly when among
      the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have in a former chapter recorded his unlucky tumble into a fountain at
      Versailles, when attempting a feat of agility in presence of the fair
      Hornecks. Water was destined to be equally baneful to him on the present
      occasion. &ldquo;Some difference of opinion,&rdquo; says the fair
      narrator, &ldquo;having arisen with Lord Harrington respecting the depth
      of a pond, the poet remarked that it was not so deep, but that, if
      anything valuable was to be found at the bottom, he would not hesitate to
      pick it up. His lordship, after some banter, threw in a guinea; Goldsmith,
      not to be outdone in this kind of bravado, in attempting to fulfill his
      promise without getting wet, accidentally fell in, to the amusement of all
      present, but persevered, brought out the money, and kept it, remarking
      that he had abundant objects on whom to bestow any further proofs of his
      lordship&rsquo;s whim or bounty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All this is recorded by the beautiful Mary Horneck, the Jessamy Bride
      herself; but while she gives these amusing pictures of poor Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      eccentricities, and of the mischievous pranks played off upon him, she
      bears unqualified testimony, which we have quoted elsewhere, to the
      qualities of his head and heart, which shone forth, in his countenance,
      and gained him the love of all who knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the circumstances of this visit vaguely called to mind by this fair
      lady in after years, was that Goldsmith read to her and her sister the
      first part of a novel which he had in hand. It was doubtless the
      manuscript mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, on which he had
      obtained an advance of money from Newbery to stave off some pressing
      debts, and to provide funds for this very visit. It never was finished.
      The bookseller, when he came afterward to examine the manuscript, objected
      to it as a mere narrative version of the Good-Natured Man. Goldsmith, too
      easily put out of conceit of his writings, threw it aside, forgetting that
      this was the very Newbery who kept his Vicar of Wakefield by him nearly
      two years through doubts of its success. The loss of the manuscript is
      deeply to be regretted; it doubtless would have been properly wrought up
      before given to the press, and might have given us new scenes in life and
      traits of character, while it could not fail to bear traces of his
      delightful style. What a pity he had not been guided by the opinions of
      his fair listeners at Barton, instead of that of the astute Mr. Newbery!

      CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      DINNER AT GENERAL OGLETHORPE&rsquo;S&mdash;ANECDOTES OF THE GENERAL&mdash;DISPUTE
      ABOUT DUELING&mdash;GHOST STORIES
    </p>
    <p>
      We have mentioned old General Oglethorpe as one of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      aristocratical acquaintances. This veteran, born in 1698, had commenced
      life early, by serving, when a mere stripling, under Prince Eugene,
      against the Turks. He had continued in military life, and been promoted to
      the rank of major-general in 1745, and received a command during the
      Scottish rebellion. Being of strong Jacobite tendencies, he was suspected
      and accused of favoring the rebels; and though acquitted by a court of
      inquiry, was never afterward employed; or, in technical language, was
      shelved. He had since been repeatedly a member of parliament, and had
      always distinguished himself by learning, taste, active benevolence, and
      high Tory principles. His name, however, has become historical, chiefly
      from his transactions in America, and the share he took in the settlement
      of the colony of Georgia. It lies embalmed in honorable immortality in a
      single line of Pope&rsquo;s:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;One, driven <i>by strong benevolence of soul</i>,
  Shall fly, like Oglethorpe, from pole to pole.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The veteran was now seventy-four years of age, but healthy and vigorous,
      and as much the preux chevalier as in his younger days, when he served
      with Prince Eugene. His table was often the gathering-place of men of
      talent. Johnson was frequently there, and delighted in drawing from the
      general details of his various &ldquo;experiences.&rdquo; He was anxious
      that he should give the world his life. &ldquo;I know no man,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;whose life would be more interesting.&rdquo; Still the vivacity
      of the general&rsquo;s mind and the variety of his knowledge made him skip
      from subject to subject too fast for the lexicographer. &ldquo;Oglethorpe,&rdquo;
      growled he, &ldquo;never completes what he has to say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell gives us an interesting and characteristic account of a dinner
      party at the general&rsquo;s (April 10, 1772), at which Goldsmith and
      Johnson were present. After dinner, when the cloth was removed,
      Oglethorpe, at Johnson&rsquo;s request, gave an account of the siege of
      Belgrade, in the true veteran style. Pouring a little wine upon the table,
      he drew his lines and parallels with a wet finger, describing the
      positions of the opposing forces. &ldquo;Here were we&mdash;here were the
      Turks,&rdquo; to all which Johnson listened with the most earnest
      attention, poring over the plans and diagrams with his usual purblind
      closeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of conversation the general gave an anecdote of himself in
      early life, when serving under Prince Eugene. Sitting at table once in
      company with a prince of Wurtemberg, the latter gave a fillip to a glass
      of wine, so as to make some of it fly in Oglethorpe&rsquo;s face. The
      manner in which it was done was somewhat equivocal. How was it to be taken
      by the stripling officer? If seriously, he must challenge the prince; but
      in so doing he might fix on himself the character of a drawcansir. If
      passed over without notice, he might be charged with cowardice. His mind
      was made up in an instant. &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;that
      is an excellent joke; but we do it much better in England.&rdquo; So
      saying, he threw a whole glass of wine in the prince&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Il
      a bien fait, mon prince,&rdquo; cried an old general present, &ldquo;vouz
      l&rsquo;avez commencé.&rdquo; (He has done right, my prince; you commenced
      it.) The prince had the good sense to acquiesce in the decision of the
      veteran, and Oglethorpe&rsquo;s retort in kind was taken in good part.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was probably at the close of this story that the officious Boswell,
      ever anxious to promote conversation for the benefit of his note-book,
      started the question whether dueling were consistent with moral duty. The
      old general fired up in an instant. &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; said he,
      with a lofty air; &ldquo;undoubtedly a man has a right to defend his
      honor.&rdquo; Goldsmith immediately carried the war into Boswell&rsquo;s
      own quarters, and pinned him with the question, &ldquo;what he would do if
      affronted?&rdquo; The pliant Boswell, who for the moment had the fear of
      the general rather than of Johnson before his eyes, replied, &ldquo;he
      should think it necessary to fight.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, then, that solves
      the question,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; thundered
      out Johnson; &ldquo;it does not follow that what a man would do, is
      therefore right.&rdquo; He, however, subsequently went into a discussion
      to show that there were necessities in the case arising out of the
      artificial refinement of society, and its proscription of any one who
      should put up with an affront without fighting a duel. &ldquo;He then,&rdquo;
      concluded he, &ldquo;who fights a duel does not fight from passion against
      his antagonist, but out of self-defense, to avert the stigma of the world,
      and to prevent himself from being driven out of society. I could wish
      there were not that superfluity of refinement; but while such notions
      prevail, no doubt a man may lawfully fight a duel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another question started was, whether people who disagreed on a capital
      point could live together in friendship. Johnson said they might.
      Goldsmith said they could not, as they had not the idem velle atque idem
      voile&mdash;the same liking and aversions. Johnson rejoined that they must
      shun the subject on which they disagreed. &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said
      Goldsmith, &ldquo;when people live together who have something as to which
      they disagree, and which they want to shun, they will be in the situation
      mentioned in the story of Blue Beard: &lsquo;you may look into all the
      chambers but one&rsquo;; but we should have the greatest inclination to
      look into that chamber, to talk of that subject.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      thundered Johnson, in a loud voice, &ldquo;I am not saying that <i>you</i>
      could live in friendship with a man from whom you differ as to some point;
      I am only saying that <i>I</i> could do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Who will not say that Goldsmith had not the best of this petty contest?
      How just was his remark! how felicitous the illustration of the blue
      chamber! how rude and overbearing was the argumentum ad hominem of
      Johnson, when he felt that he had the worst of the argument!
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation turned upon ghosts! General Oglethorpe told the story of
      a Colonel Prendergast, an officer in the Duke of Marlborough&rsquo;s army,
      who predicted among his comrades that he should die on a certain day. The
      battle of Malplaquet took place on that day. The colonel was in the midst
      of it but came out unhurt. The firing had ceased, and his brother officers
      jested with him about the fallacy of his prediction. &ldquo;The day is not
      over,&rdquo; replied he, gravely, &ldquo;I shall die notwithstanding what
      you see.&rdquo; His words proved true. The order for a cessation of firing
      had not reached one of the French batteries, and a random shot from it
      killed the colonel on the spot. Among his effects was found a pocketbook
      in which he had made a solemn entry, that Sir John Friend, who had been
      executed for high treason, had appeared to him, either in a dream or
      vision, and predicted that he would meet him on a certain day (the very
      day of the battle). Colonel Cecil, who took possession of the effects of
      Colonel Prendergast, and read the entry in the pocketbook, told this story
      to Pope, the poet, in the presence of General Oglethorpe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story, as related by the general, appears to have been well received,
      if not credited, by both Johnson and Goldsmith, each of whom had something
      to relate in kind. Goldsmith&rsquo;s brother, the clergyman in whom he had
      such implicit confidence, had assured him of his having seen an
      apparition. Johnson also had a friend, old Mr. Cave, the printer, at St.
      John&rsquo;s Gate, &ldquo;an honest man, and a sensible man,&rdquo; who
      told him he had seen a ghost: he did not, however, like to talk of it, and
      seemed to be in great horror, whenever it was mentioned. &ldquo;And pray,
      sir,&rdquo; asked Boswell, &ldquo;what did he say was the appearance?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Why, sir, something of a shadowy being.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will not be surprised at this superstitious turn in the
      conversation of such intelligent men, when he recollects that, but a few
      years before this time, all London had been agitated by the absurd story
      of the Cock Lane ghost; a matter which Dr. Johnson had deemed worthy of
      his serious investigation, and about which Goldsmith had written a
      pamphlet.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      MR. JOSEPH CRADOCK&mdash;AN AUTHOR&rsquo;S CONFIDINGS&mdash;AN AMANUENSIS&mdash;LIFE
      AT EDGEWARE&mdash;GOLDSMITH CONJURING&mdash;GEORGE COLMAN&mdash;THE
      FANTOCCINI
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the agreeable acquaintances made by Goldsmith about this time was a
      Mr. Joseph Cradock, a young gentleman of Leicestershire, living at his
      ease, but disposed to &ldquo;make himself uneasy,&rdquo; by meddling with
      literature and the theater; in fact, he had a passion for plays and
      players, and had come up to town with a modified translation of Voltaire&rsquo;s
      tragedy of Zobeide, in a view to get it acted. There was no great
      difficulty in the case, as he was a man of fortune, had letters of
      introduction to persons of note, and was altogether in a different
      position from the indigent man of genius whom managers might harass with
      impunity. Goldsmith met him at the house of Yates, the actor, and finding
      that he was a friend of Lord Clare, soon became sociable with him. Mutual
      tastes quickened the intimacy, especially as they found means of serving
      each other. Goldsmith wrote an epilogue for the tragedy of Zobeide; and
      Cradock, who was an amateur musician, arranged the music for the Threnodia
      Augustalis, a lament on the death of the Princess Dowager of Wales, the
      political mistress and patron of Lord Clare, which Goldsmith had thrown
      off hastily to please that nobleman. The tragedy was played with some
      success at Covent Garden; the Lament was recited and sung at Mrs. Cornelys&rsquo;
      rooms&mdash;a very fashionable resort in Soho Square, got up by a woman of
      enterprise of that name. It was in whimsical parody of those gay and
      somewhat promiscuous assemblages that Goldsmith used to call the motley
      evening parties at his lodgings &ldquo;little Cornelys.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Threnodia Augustalis was not publicly known to be by Goldsmith until
      several years after his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cradock was one of the few polite intimates who felt more disposed to
      sympathize with the generous qualities of the poet than to sport with his
      eccentricities. He sought his society whenever he came to town, and
      occasionally had him to his seat in the country. Goldsmith appreciated his
      sympathy, and unburdened himself to him without reserve. Seeing the
      lettered ease in which this amateur author was enabled to live, and the
      time he could bestow on the elaboration of a manuscript, &ldquo;Ah! Mr.
      Cradock,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;think of me that must write a volume
      every month!&rdquo; He complained to him of the attempts made by inferior
      writers, and by others who could scarcely come under that denomination,
      not only to abuse and depreciate his writings, but to render him
      ridiculous as a man; perverting every harmless sentiment and action into
      charges of absurdity, malice, or folly. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, in the
      fullness of his heart, &ldquo;I am as a lion bated by curs!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Another acquaintance which he made about this time, was a young countryman
      of the name of M&rsquo;Donnell, whom he met in a state of destitution,
      and, of course, befriended. The following grateful recollections of his
      kindness and his merits were furnished by that person in after years:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the year 1772,&rdquo; writes he, &ldquo;that the death of
      my elder brother&mdash;when in London, on my way to Ireland&mdash;left me
      in a most forlorn situation; I was then about eighteen; I possessed
      neither friends nor money, nor the means of getting to Ireland, of which
      or of England I knew scarcely anything, from having so long resided in
      France. In this situation I had strolled about for two or three days,
      considering what to do, but unable to come to any determination, when
      Providence directed me to the Temple Gardens. I threw myself on a seat,
      and, willing to forget my miseries for a moment, drew out a book; that
      book was a volume of Boileau. I had not been there long when a gentleman,
      strolling about, passed near me, and observing, perhaps, something Irish
      or foreign in my garb or countenance, addressed me: &lsquo;Sir, you seem
      studious; I hope you find this a favorable place to pursue it.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Not very studious, sir; I fear it is the want of society that
      brings me hither; I am solitary and unknown in this metropolis&rsquo;; and
      a passage from Cicero&mdash;Oratio pro Archia&mdash;occurring to me, I
      quoted it; &lsquo;Haec studia pronoctant nobiscum, perigrinantur,
      rusticantur.&rsquo; &lsquo;You are a scholar, too, sir, I perceive.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;A piece of one, sir; but I ought still to have been in the college
      where I had the good fortune to pick up the little I know.&rsquo; A good
      deal of conversation ensued; I told him part of my history, and he, in
      return, gave his address in the Temple, desiring me to call soon, from
      which, to my infinite surprise and gratification, I found that the person
      who thus seemed to take an interest in my fate was my countryman, and a
      distinguished ornament of letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not fail to keep the appointment, and was received in the
      kindest manner. He told me, smilingly, that he was not rich; that he could
      do little for me in direct pecuniary aid, but would endeavor to put me in
      the way of doing something for myself; observing, that he could at least
      furnish me with advice not wholly useless to a young man placed in the
      heart of a great metropolis. &lsquo;In London,&rsquo; he continued,
      &lsquo;nothing is to be got for nothing; you must work; and no man who
      chooses to be industrious need be under obligations to another, for here
      labor of every kind commands its reward. If you think proper to assist me
      occasionally as amanuensis, I shall be obliged, and you will be placed
      under no obligation, until something more permanent can be secured for
      you.&rsquo; This employment, which I pursued for some time, was to
      translate passages from Buffon, which was abridged or altered, according
      to circumstances, for his Natural History.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s literary tasks were fast getting ahead of him, and he
      began now to &ldquo;toil after them in vain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Five volumes of the Natural History here spoken of had long since been
      paid for by Mr. Griffin, yet most of them were still to be written. His
      young amanuensis bears testimony to his embarrassments and perplexities,
      but to the degree of equanimity with which he bore them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been said,&rdquo; observes he, &ldquo;that he was irritable.
      Such may have been the case at times; nay, I believe it was so; for what
      with the continual pursuit of authors, printers, and booksellers, and
      occasional pecuniary embarrassments, few could have avoided exhibiting
      similar marks of impatience. But it was never so toward me. I saw him only
      in his bland and kind moods, with a flow, perhaps an overflow, of the milk
      of human kindness for all who were in any manner dependent upon him. I
      looked upon him with awe and veneration, and he upon me as a kind parent
      upon a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His manner and address exhibited much frankness and cordiality,
      particularly to those with whom he possessed any degree of intimacy. His
      good-nature was equally apparent. Ton could not dislike the man, although
      several of his follies and foibles you might be tempted to condemn. He was
      generous and inconsiderate; money with him had little value.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To escape from many of the tormentors just alluded to, and to devote
      himself without interruption to his task, Goldsmith took lodgings for the
      summer at a farmhouse near the six-mile stone on the Edgeware road, and
      carried down his books in two return post-chaises. He used to say he
      believed the farmer&rsquo;s family thought him an odd character, similar
      to that in which the &ldquo;Spectator&rdquo; appeared to his landlady and
      her children: he was &ldquo;The Gentleman.&rdquo; Boswell tells us that he
      went to visit him at the place in company with Mickle, translator of the
      Lusiad. Goldsmith was not at home. Having a curiosity to see his
      apartment, however, they went in, and found curious scraps of descriptions
      of animals scrawled upon the wall with a black lead pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmhouse in question is still in existence, though much altered. It
      stands upon a gentle eminence in Hyde Lane, commanding a pleasant prospect
      toward Hendon. The room is still pointed out in which She Stoops to
      Conquer was written; a convenient and airy apartment, up one Sight of
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some matter-of-fact traditions concerning the author were furnished, a few
      years since, by a son of the farmer, who was sixteen years of age at the
      time Goldsmith resided with his father. Though he had engaged to board
      with the family, his meals were generally sent to him in his room, in
      which he passed the most of his time, negligently dressed, with his shirt
      collar open, busily engaged in writing. Sometimes, probably when in moods
      of composition, he would wander into the kitchen, without noticing any
      one, stand musing with his back to the fire, and then hurry off again to
      his room, no doubt to commit to paper some thought which had struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he strolled about the fields, or was to be seen loitering and
      reading and musing under the hedges. He was subject to fits of wakefulness
      and read much in bed; if not disposed to read, he still kept the candle
      burning; if he wished to extinguish it, and it was out of his reach, he
      flung his slipper at it, which would be found in the morning near the
      overturned candlestick, and daubed with grease. He was noted here, as
      everywhere else, for his charitable feelings. No beggar applied to him in
      vain, and he evinced on all occasions great commiseration for the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the use of the parlor to receive and entertain company, and was
      visited by Sir Joshua Reynolds, Hugh Boyd, the reputed author of Junius,
      Sir William Chambers, and other distinguished characters. He gave
      occasionally, though rarely, a dinner party; and on one occasion, when his
      guests were detained by a thunder shower, he got up a dance, and carried
      the merriment late into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual, he was the promoter of hilarity among the young, and at one time
      took the children of the house to see a company of strolling players at
      Hendon. The greatest amusement to the party, however, was derived from his
      own jokes on the road and his comments on the performance, which produced
      infinite laughter among his youthful companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near to his rural retreat at Edgeware, a Mr. Seguin, an Irish merchant, of
      literary tastes, had country quarters for his family, where Goldsmith was
      always welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this family he would indulge in playful and even grotesque humor, and
      was ready for anything&mdash;conversation, music, or a game of romps. He
      prided himself upon his dancing, and would walk a minuet with Mrs. Seguin,
      to the infinite amusement of herself and the children, whose shouts of
      laughter he bore with perfect good-humor. He would sing Irish songs, and
      the Scotch ballad of Johnny Armstrong. He took the lead in the children&rsquo;s
      sports of blind man&rsquo;s buff, hunt the slipper, etc., or in their
      games at cards, and was the most noisy of the party, affecting to cheat
      and to be excessively eager to win; while with children of smaller size he
      would turn the hind part of his wig before, and play all kinds of tricks
      to amuse them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One word as to his musical skill and his performance on the flute, which
      comes up so invariably in all his fireside revels. He really knew nothing
      of music scientifically; he had a good ear, and may have played sweetly;
      but we are told he could not read a note of music. Roubillac, the
      statuary, once played a trick upon him in this respect. He pretended to
      score down an air as the poet played it, but put down crotchets and
      semi-breves at random. When he had finished, Goldsmith cast his eyes over
      it and pronounced it correct! It is possible that his execution in music
      was like his style in writing; in sweetness and melody he may have
      snatched a grace beyond the reach of art!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at all times a capital companion for children, and knew how to fall
      in with their humors. &ldquo;I little thought,&rdquo; said Miss Hawkins,
      the woman grown, &ldquo;what I should have to boast, when Goldsmith taught
      me to play Jack and Jill by two bits of paper on his fingers.&rdquo; He
      entertained Mrs. Garrick, we are told, with a whole budget of stories and
      songs; delivered the Chimney Sweep with exquisite taste as a solo; and
      performed a duet with Garrick of Old Rose and Burn the Bellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only five years old,&rdquo; says the late George Colman,
      &ldquo;when Goldsmith one evening, when drinking coffee with my father,
      took me on his knee and began to play with me, which amiable act I
      returned with a very smart slap in the face; it must have been a tingler,
      for I left the marks of my little spiteful paw upon his cheek. This
      infantile outrage was followed by summary justice, and I was locked up by
      my father in an adjoining room, to undergo solitary imprisonment in the
      dark. Here I began to howl and scream most abominably. At length a friend
      appeared to extricate me from jeopardy; it was the good-natured doctor
      himself, with a lighted candle in his hand, and a smile upon his
      countenance, which was still partially red from the effects of my
      petulance. I sulked and sobbed, and he fondled and soothed until I began
      to brighten. He seized the propitious moment, placed three hats upon the
      carpet, and a shilling under each; the shillings, he told me, were
      England, France, and Spain. &lsquo;Hey, presto, cockolorum!&rsquo; cried
      the doctor, and, lo! on uncovering the shillings, they were all found
      congregated under one. I was no politician at the time, and therefore
      might not have wondered at the sudden revolution which brought England,
      France, and Spain all under one crown; but, as I was also no conjurer, it
      amazed me beyond measure. From that time, whenever the doctor came to
      visit my father,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;I pluck&rsquo;d his gown to share the good man&rsquo;s smile&rsquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      a game of romps constantly ensued, and we were always cordial friends and
      merry playfellows.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Goldsmith made the Edgeware farmhouse his headquarters for the
      summer, he would absent himself for weeks at a time on visits to Mr.
      Cradock, Lord Clare, and Mr. Langton, at their country-seats. He would
      often visit town, also, to dine and partake of the public amusements. On
      one occasion he accompanied Edmund Burke to witness a performance of the
      Italian Fantoccini or Puppets, in Panton Street; an exhibition which had
      hit the caprice of the town, and was in great vogue. The puppets were set
      in motion by wires, so well concealed as to be with difficulty detected.
      Boswell, with his usual obtuseness with respect to Goldsmith, accuses him
      of being jealous of the puppets! &ldquo;When Burke,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;praised the dexterity with which one of them tossed a pike, &lsquo;Pshaw,&rsquo;
      said Goldsmith <i>with some warmth</i>, &lsquo;I can do it better myself.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      &ldquo;The same evening,&rdquo; adds Boswell, &ldquo;when supping at Burke&rsquo;s
      lodgings, he broke his shin by attempting to exhibit to the company how
      much better he could jump over a stick than the puppets.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith jealous of puppets! This even passes in absurdity Boswell&rsquo;s
      charge upon him of being jealous of the beauty of the two Misses Horneck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Panton Street puppets were destined to be a source of further
      amusement to the town, and of annoyance to the little autocrat of the
      stage. Foote, the Aristophanes of the English drama, who was always on the
      alert to turn every subject of popular excitement to account, seeing the
      success of the Fantoccini, gave out that he should produce a Primitive
      Puppet-show at the Haymarket, to be entitled the Handsome Chambermaid, or
      Piety in Pattens: intended to burlesque the <i>sentimental comedy</i>
      which Garrick still maintained at Drury Lane. The idea of a play to be
      performed in a regular theater by puppets excited the curiosity and talk
      of the town. &ldquo;Will your puppets be as large as life, Mr. Foote?&rdquo;
      demanded a lady of rank. &ldquo;Oh, no, my lady,&rdquo; replied Foote,
      &ldquo;<i>not much larger than Garrick</i>.&rdquo;

      RANELAGH
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith returned to town in the autumn (1772), with his health much
      disordered. His close fits of sedentary application, during which he in a
      manner tied himself to the mast, had laid the seeds of a lurking malady in
      his system, and produced a severe illness in the course of the summer.
      Town life was not favorable to the health either of body or mind. He could
      not resist the siren voice of temptation, which, now that he had become a
      notoriety, assailed him on every side. Accordingly we find him launching
      away in a career of social dissipation; dining and supping out; at clubs,
      at routs, at theaters; he is a guest with Johnson at the Thrales, and an
      object of Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s lively sallies; he is a lion at Mrs. Vesey&rsquo;s
      and Mrs. Montagu&rsquo;s, where some of the high-bred blue-stockings
      pronounce him a &ldquo;wild genius,&rdquo; and others, peradventure, a
      &ldquo;wild Irishman.&rdquo; In the meantime his pecuniary difficulties
      are increasing upon him, conflicting with his proneness to pleasure and
      expense, and contributing by the harassment of his mind to the wear and
      tear of his constitution. His Animated Nature, though not finished, had
      been entirely paid for, and the money spent. The money advanced by Garrick
      on Newbery&rsquo;s note still hangs over him as a debt. The tale on which
      Newbery had loaned from two to three hundred pounds previous to the
      excursion to Barton has proved a failure. The bookseller is urgent for the
      settlement of his complicated account; the perplexed author has nothing to
      offer him in liquidation but the copyright of the comedy which he has in
      his portfolio; &ldquo;Though to tell you the truth, Frank,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;there are great doubts of its success.&rdquo; The offer was
      accepted, and, like bargains wrung from Goldsmith in times of emergency,
      turned out a golden speculation to the bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way Goldsmith went on &ldquo;outrunning the constable,&rdquo; as
      he termed it; spending everything in advance; working with an overtasked
      head and weary heart to pay for past pleasures and past extravagance, and
      at the same time incurring new debts, to perpetuate his struggles and
      darken his future prospects. While the excitement of society and the
      excitement of composition conspire to keep up a feverishness of the
      system, he has incurred an unfortunate habit of quacking himself with
      James&rsquo; powders, a fashionable panacea of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A farce, produced this year by Garrick, and entitled The Irish Widow,
      perpetuates the memory of practical jokes played off a year or two
      previously upon the alleged vanity of poor, simple-hearted Goldsmith. He
      was one evening at the house of his friend Burke, when he was beset by a
      tenth muse, an Irish widow and authoress, just arrived from Ireland, full
      of brogue and blunders, and poetic fire and rantipole gentility. She was
      soliciting subscriptions for her poems; and assailed Goldsmith for his
      patronage; the great Goldsmith&mdash;her countryman, and of course her
      friend. She overpowered him with eulogiums on his own poems, and then read
      some of her own, with vehemence of tone and gesture, appealing continually
      to the great Goldsmith to know how he relished them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Goldsmith did all that a kind-hearted and gallant gentleman could do
      hi such a case; he praised her poems as far as the stomach of his sense
      would permit: perhaps a little further; he offered her his subscription,
      and it was not until she had retired with many parting compliments to the
      great Goldsmith that he pronounced the poetry which had been inflicted on
      him execrable. The whole scene had been a hoax got up by Burke for the
      amusement of his company, and the Irish widow, so admirably performed, had
      been personated by a Mrs. Balfour, a lady of his connection, of great
      sprightliness and talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We see nothing in the story to establish the alleged vanity of Goldsmith,
      but we think it tells rather to the disadvantage of Burke; being
      unwarrantable under their relations of friendship, and a species of
      waggery quite beneath his genius. Croker, in his notes to Boswell, gives
      another of these practical jokes perpetrated by Burke at the expense of
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s credulity. It was related to Croker by Colonel O&rsquo;Moore,
      of Cloghan Castle, in Ireland, who was a party concerned. The colonel and
      Burke, walking one day through Leicester Square on their way to Sir Joshua
      Reynolds&rsquo;, with whom they were to dine, observed Goldsmith, who was
      likewise to be a guest, standing and regarding a crowd which was staring
      and shouting at some foreign ladies in the window of a hotel. &ldquo;Observe
      Goldsmith,&rdquo; said Burke to O&rsquo;Moore, &ldquo;and mark what passes
      between us at Sir Joshua&rsquo;s.&rdquo; They passed on and reached there
      before him. Burke received Goldsmith with affected reserve and coldness;
      being pressed to explain the reason. &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;I am ashamed to keep company with a person who could act as you
      have just done in the Square.&rdquo; Goldsmith protested he was ignorant
      of what was meant. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Burke, &ldquo;did you not
      exclaim as you were looking up at those women, what stupid beasts the
      crowd must be for staring with such admiration at those <i>painted
      Jezebels</i>, while a man of your talents passed by unnoticed?&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Surely, surely, my dear friend,&rdquo; cried Goldsmith, with alarm,
      &ldquo;surely I did not say so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied Burke,
      &ldquo;if you had not said so, how should I have known it?&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      true,&rdquo; answered Goldsmith, &ldquo;I am very sorry&mdash;it was very
      foolish: <i>I do recollect that something thing of the kind passed through
      my mind, but I did not think I had uttered it</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is proper to observe that these jokes were played off by Burke before
      he had attained the full eminence of his social position, and that he may
      have felt privileged to take liberties with Goldsmith as his countryman
      and college associate. It is evident, however, that the peculiarities of
      the latter, and his guileless simplicity, made him a butt for the broad
      waggery of some of his associates; while others more polished, though
      equally perfidious, are on the watch to give currency to his bulls and
      blunders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Stratford jubilee, in honor of Shakespeare, where Boswell had made a
      fool of himself, was still in every one&rsquo;s mind. It was sportively
      suggested that a fete should be held at Lichfield in honor of Johnson and
      Garrick, and that the Beaux&rsquo; Stratagem should be played by the
      members of the Literary Club. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; exclaimed Goldsmith,
      &ldquo;I shall certainly play Scrub. I should like of all things to try my
      hand at that character.&rdquo; The unwary speech, which any one else might
      have made without comment, has been thought worthy of record as
      whimsically characteristic. Beauclerc was extremely apt to circulate
      anecdotes at his expense, founded perhaps on some trivial incident, but
      dressed up with the embellishments of his sarcastic brain. One relates to
      a venerable dish of peas, served up at Sir Joshua&rsquo;s table, which
      should have been green, but were any other color. A wag suggested to
      Goldsmith, in a whisper, that they should be sent to Hammersmith, as that
      was the way to <i>turn-em-green</i> (Turnham-Green). Goldsmith, delighted
      with the pun, endeavored to repeat it at Burke&rsquo;s table, but missed
      the point. &ldquo;That is the way to <i>make</i> &lsquo;em green,&rdquo;
      said he. Nobody laughed. He perceived he was at fault. &ldquo;I mean that
      is the <i>road</i> to turn &lsquo;em green.&rdquo; A dead pause and a
      stare; &ldquo;whereupon,&rdquo; adds Beauclerc, &ldquo;he started up
      disconcerted and abruptly left the table.&rdquo; This is evidently one of
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s caricatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion the poet and Beauclerc were seated at the theater next
      to Lord Shelburne, the minister, whom political writers thought proper to
      nickname Malagrida. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Goldsmith to his
      lordship, in the course of conversation, &ldquo;that I never could
      conceive why they called you Malagrida, <i>for</i> Malagrida was a very
      good sort of man.&rdquo; This was too good a trip of the tongue for
      Beauclerc to let pass: he serves it up in his next letter to Lord
      Charlemont, as a specimen of a mode of turning a thought the wrong way,
      peculiar to the poet; he makes merry over it with his witty and sarcastic
      compeer, Horace Walpole, who pronounces it &ldquo;a picture of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      whole life.&rdquo; Dr. Johnson alone, when he hears it bandied about as
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s last blunder, growls forth a friendly defense: &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;it was a mere blunder in emphasis. He meant to say, I
      wonder they should use Malagrida as a term of reproach.&rdquo; Poor
      Goldsmith! On such points he was ever doomed to be misinterpreted. Rogers,
      the poet, meeting in times long subsequent with a survivor of those days,
      asked him what Goldsmith really was in conversation. The old
      conversational character was too deeply stamped in the memory of the
      veteran to be effaced. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the old wiseacre,
      &ldquo;<i>he was a fool</i>. The right word never came to him. If you gave
      him back a bad shilling, he&rsquo;d say, Why, it&rsquo;s as good a
      shilling as ever was <i>born</i>. You know he ought to have said <i>coined</i>.
      <i>Coined</i>, sir, never entered his head. <i>He was a fool, sir</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We have so many anecdotes in which Goldsmith&rsquo;s simplicity is played
      upon that it is quite a treat to meet with one in which he is represented
      playing upon the simplicity of others, especially when the victim of his
      joke is the &ldquo;Great Cham&rdquo; himself, whom all others are disposed
      to hold so much in awe. Goldsmith and Johnson were supping cozily together
      at a tavern in Dean Street, Soho, kept by Jack Roberts, a singer at Drury
      Lane, and a protege of Garrick&rsquo;s. Johnson delighted in these
      gastronomical tete-a-tetes, and was expatiating in high good-humor on
      rumps and kidneys, the veins of his forehead swelling with the ardor of
      mastication. &ldquo;These,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are pretty little
      things; but a man must eat a great many of them before he is filled.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Ay; but how many of them,&rdquo; asked Goldsmith, with affected
      simplicity, &ldquo;would reach to the moon?&rdquo; &ldquo;To the moon! Ah,
      sir, that, I fear, exceeds your calculation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not at all,
      sir; I think I could tell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray, then, sir, let us hear.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Why, sir, one, <i>if it were long enough</i>!&rdquo; Johnson
      growled for a time at finding himself caught in such a trite schoolboy
      trap. &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; cried he at length, &ldquo;I have deserved
      it. I should not have provoked so foolish an answer by so foolish a
      question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the many incidents related as illustrative of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      vanity and envy is one which occurred one evening when he was in a
      drawing-room with a party of ladies, and a ballad-singer under the window
      struck up his favorite song of Sally Salisbury. &ldquo;How miserably this
      woman sings!&rdquo; exclaimed he. &ldquo;Pray, doctor,&rdquo; said the
      lady of the house, &ldquo;could you do it better?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,
      madam, and the company shall be judges.&rdquo; The company, of course,
      prepared to be entertained by an absurdity; but their smiles were wellnigh
      turned to tears, for he acquitted himself with a skill and pathos that
      drew universal applause. He had, in fact, a delicate ear for music, which
      had been jarred by the false notes of the ballad-singer; and there were
      certain pathetic ballads, associated with recollections of his childhood,
      which were sure to touch the springs of his heart. We have another story
      of him, connected with ballad-singing, which is still more characteristic.
      He was one evening at the house of Sir William Chambers, in Berners
      Street, seated at a whist table with Sir William, Lady Chambers, and
      Baretti, when all at once he threw down his cards, hurried out of the room
      and into the street. He returned in an instant, resumed his seat, and the
      game went on. Sir William, after a little hesitation, ventured to ask the
      cause of his retreat, fearing he had been overcome by the heat of the
      room. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith; &ldquo;but in truth I
      could not bear to hear that unfortunate woman in the street, half singing,
      half sobbing, for such tones could only arise from the extremity of
      distress; her voice grated painfully on my ear and jarred my frame, so
      that I could not rest until I had sent her away.&rdquo; It was in fact a
      poor ballad-singer, whose cracked voice had been heard by others of the
      party, but without having the same effect on their sensibilities. It was
      the reality of his fictitious scene in the story of the &ldquo;Man in
      Black&rdquo;; wherein he describes a woman in rags with one child in her
      arms and another on her back, attempting to sing ballads, but with such a
      mournful voice that it was difficult to determine whether she was singing
      or crying. &ldquo;A wretch,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;who, in the deepest
      distress, still aimed at good-humor, was an object my friend was by no
      means capable of withstanding.&rdquo; The Man in Black gave the poor woman
      all that he had&mdash;a bundle of matches. Goldsmith, it is probable, sent
      his ballad-singer away rejoicing with all the money in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranelagh was at that time greatly in vogue as a place of public
      entertainment. It was situated near Chelsea; the principal room was a
      rotunda of great dimensions, with an orchestra in the center and tiers of
      boxes all round. It was a place to which Johnson resorted occasionally.
      &ldquo;I am a great friend to public amusements,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for
      they keep people from vice.&rdquo; [Footnote: &ldquo;Alas, sir!&rdquo;
      said Johnson, speaking, when in another mood, of grand houses, fine
      gardens, and splendid places of public amusement; &ldquo;alas, sir! these
      are only struggles for happiness. When I first entered Ranelagh it gave an
      expansion and gay sensation to my mind, such as I never experienced
      anywhere else. But, as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immense army, and
      considered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred
      years afterward, so it went to my heart to consider that there was not one
      in all that brilliant circle that was not afraid to go home and think.&rdquo;]
      Goldsmith was equally a friend to them, though perhaps not altogether on
      such moral grounds. He was particularly fond of masquerades, which were
      then exceedingly popular, and got up at Ranelagh with great expense and
      magnificence. Sir Joshua Reynolds, who had likewise a taste for such
      amusements, was sometimes his companion, at other times he went alone; his
      peculiarities of person and manner would soon betray him, whatever might
      be his disguise, and he would be singled out by wags, acquainted with his
      foibles, and more successful than himself in maintaining their incognito,
      as a capital subject to be played upon. Some, pretending not to know him,
      would decry his writings, and praise those of his contemporaries; others
      would laud his verses to the skies, but purposely misquote and burlesque
      them; others would annoy him with parodies; while one young lady, whom he
      was teasing, as he supposed, with great success and infinite humor,
      silenced his rather boisterous laughter by quoting his own line about
      &ldquo;the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind.&rdquo; On one occasion
      he was absolutely driven out of the house by the persevering jokes of a
      wag, whose complete disguise gave him no means of retaliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His name appearing in the newspapers among the distinguished persons
      present at one of these amusements, his old enemy, Kenrick, immediately
      addressed to him a copy of anonymous verses, to the following purport.
    </p>
    <h3>
      TO DR. GOLDSMITH
    </h3>
    <h3>
      ON SEEING HIS NAME IN THE LIST OF MUMMERS AT THE LATE MASQUERADE
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;How widely different, Goldsmith, are the ways
  Of doctors now, and those of ancient days!
  Theirs taught the truth in academic shades,
  Ours in lewd hops and midnight masquerades.
  So changed the times! say, philosophic sage,
  Whose genius suits so well this tasteful age,
  Is the Pantheon, late a sink obscene,
  Become the fountain of chaste Hippocrene?
  Or do thy moral numbers quaintly flow,
  Inspired by th&rsquo; <i>Aganippe</i> of Soho?
  Do wisdom&rsquo;s sons gorge cates and vermicelli,
  Like beastly Bickerstaffe or bothering Kelly?
  Or art thou tired of th&rsquo; undeserved applause
  Bestowed on bards affecting Virtue&rsquo;s cause?
  Is this the good that makes the humble vain,
  The good philosophy should not disdain?
  If so, let pride dissemble all it can,
  A modern sage is still much less than man.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Goldsmith was keenly sensitive to attacks of the kind, and meeting Kenrick
      at the Chapter Coffee-house, called him to sharp account for taking such a
      liberty with his name, and calling his morals in question, merely on
      account of his being seen at a place of general resort and amusement.
      Kenrick shuffled and sneaked, protesting that he meant nothing derogatory
      to his private character. Goldsmith let him know, however, that he was
      aware of his having more than once indulged in attacks of this dastard
      kind, and intimated that another such outrage would be followed by
      personal chastisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kenrick having played the craven in his presence, avenged himself as soon
      as he was gone by complaining of his having made a wanton attack upon him,
      and by making coarse comments upon his writings, conversation and person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scurrilous satire of Kenrick, however unmerited, may have checked
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s taste for masquerades. Sir Joshua Reynolds, calling on
      the poet one morning, found him walking about his room in somewhat of a
      reverie, kicking a bundle of clothes before him like a football. It proved
      to be an expensive masquerade dress, which he said he had been fool enough
      to purchase, and as there was no other way of getting the worth of his
      money, he was trying to take it out in exercise.

      CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      INVITATION TO CHRISTMAS&mdash;THE SPRING VELVET COAT&mdash;THE HAYMAKING
      WIG&mdash;THE MISCHANCES OF LOO&mdash;THE FAIR CULPRIT&mdash;A DANCE WITH
      THE JESSAMY BRIDE
    </p>
    <p>
      From the feverish dissipations of town, Goldsmith is summoned away to
      partake of the genial dissipations of the country. In the month of
      December, a letter from Mrs. Bunbury invites him down to Barton, to pass
      the Christmas holidays. The letter is written in the usual playful vein
      which marks his intercourse with this charming family. He is to come in
      his &ldquo;smart spring-velvet coat,&rdquo; to bring a new wig to dance
      with the haymakers in, and, above all, to follow the advice of herself and
      her sister (the Jessamy Bride), in playing loo. This letter, which plays
      so archly, yet kindly, with some of poor Goldsmith&rsquo;s peculiarities,
      and bespeaks such real ladylike regard for him, requires a word or two of
      annotation. The spring-velvet suit alluded to appears to have been a
      gallant adornment (somewhat in the style of the famous bloom-colored coat)
      in which Goldsmith had figured in the preceding month of May&mdash;the
      season of blossoms&mdash;for, on the 21st of that month we find the
      following entry in the chronicle of Mr. William Filby, tailor: <i>To your
      blue velvet suit</i>, £21 10s. 9d. Also, about the same time, a suit of
      livery and a crimson collar for the serving man. Again we hold the Jessamy
      Bride responsible for this gorgeous splendor of wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new wig no doubt is a bag-wig and solitaire, still highly the mode,
      and in which Goldsmith is represented as figuring when in full dress,
      equipped with his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the dancing with the haymakers, we presume it alludes to some gambol
      of the poet, in the course of his former visit to Barton; when he ranged
      the fields and lawns a chartered libertine, and tumbled into the
      fish-ponds.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the suggestions about loo, they are in sportive allusion to the
      doctor&rsquo;s mode of playing that game in their merry evening parties;
      affecting the desperate gambler and easy dupe; running counter to all
      rule; making extravagant ventures; reproaching all others with cowardice;
      dashing at all hazards at the pool, and getting himself completely loo&rsquo;d,
      to the great amusement of the company. The drift of the fair sisters&rsquo;
      advice was most probably to tempt him on, and then leave him in the lurch.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these comments we subjoin Goldsmith&rsquo;s reply to Mrs. Bunbury, a
      fine piece of off-hand, humorous writing, which has but in late years been
      given to the public, and which throws a familiar light on the social
      circle at Barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam&mdash;I read your letter with all that allowance which
      critical candor could require, but after all find so much to object to,
      and so much to raise my indignation, that I cannot help giving it a
      serious answer. I am not so ignorant, madam, as not to see there are many
      sarcasms contained in it, and solecisms also. (Solecism is a word that
      comes from the town of Soleis in Attica, among the Greeks, built by Solon,
      and applied as we use the word Kidderminster for curtains from a town also
      of that name&mdash;but this is learning you have no taste for!)&mdash;I
      say, madam, there are many sarcasms in it, and solecisms also. But not to
      seem an ill-natured critic, I&rsquo;ll take leave to quote your own words,
      and give you my remarks upon them as they occur. You begin as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;I hope, my good doctor, you soon will be here,
  And your spring-velvet coat very smart will appear,
  To open our ball the first day of the year.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, madam, where did you ever find the epithet &lsquo;good,&rsquo;
      applied to the title of doctor? Had you called me &lsquo;learned doctor,&rsquo;
      or &lsquo;grave doctor,&rsquo; or &lsquo;noble doctor,&rsquo; it might be
      allowable, because they belong to the profession. But, not to cavil at
      trifles, you talk of &lsquo;my spring-velvet coat,&rsquo; and advise me to
      wear it the first day in the year, that is, in the middle of winter!&mdash;a
      spring-velvet coat in the middle of winter!!! That would be a solecism
      indeed! and yet to increase the inconsistence, in another part of your
      letter you call me a beau. Now, on one side or other you must be wrong. If
      I am a beau, I can never think of wearing a spring-velvet in winter; and
      if I am not a beau, why then, that explains itself. But let me go on to
      your two next strange lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;And bring with you a wig, that is modish and gay,
  To dance with the girls that are makers of hay.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The absurdity of making hay at Christmas you yourself seem sensible
      of: you say your sister will laugh; and so indeed she well may! The Latins
      have an expression for a contemptuous kind of laughter, &lsquo;naso
      contemnere adunco&rsquo;; that is, to laugh with a crooked nose. She may
      laugh at you in the manner of the ancients if she thinks fit. But now I
      come to the most extraordinary of all extraordinary propositions, which
      is, to take your and your sister&rsquo;s advice in playing at loo. The
      presumption of the offer raises my indignation beyond the bounds of prose;
      it inspires me at once with verse and resentment. I take advice! and from
      whom? You shall hear.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;First let me suppose, what may shortly be true,
  The company set, and the word to be Loo:
  All smirking, and pleasant, and big with adventure,
  And ogling the stake which is fix&rsquo;d in the center.
  Round and round go the cards, while I inwardly damn
  At never once finding a visit from Pam.
  I lay down my stake, apparently cool,
  While the harpies about me all pocket the pool.
  I fret in my gizzard, yet, cautious and sly,
  I wish all my friends may be bolder than I:
  Yet still they sit snug, not a creature will aim
  By losing their money to venture at fame.
  &lsquo;Tis in vain that at niggardly caution I scold,
  &lsquo;Tis in vain that I flatter the brave and the bold:
  All play their own way, and they think me an ass,...
  &lsquo;What does Mrs. Bunbury?&rsquo; ... &lsquo;I, Sir? I pass.&rsquo;
  &lsquo;Pray what does Miss Horneck? take courage, come do,&rsquo;...
  &lsquo;Who, I? let me see, sir, why I must pass too.&rsquo;
  Mr. Bunbury frets, and I fret like the devil,
  To see them so cowardly, lucky, and civil.
  Yet still I sit snug, and continue to sigh on,
  Till, made by my losses as bold as a lion,
  I venture at all, while my avarice regards
  The whole pool as my own... &lsquo;Come, give me five cards.&rsquo;
  &lsquo;Well done!&rsquo; cry the ladies; &lsquo;Ah, doctor, that&rsquo;s good!
  The pool&rsquo;s very rich,... ah! the doctor is loo&rsquo;d!&rsquo;
  Thus foil&rsquo;d in my courage, on all sides perplext,
  I ask for advice from the lady that&rsquo;s next:
  &lsquo;Pray, ma&rsquo;am, be so good as to give your advice;
  Don&rsquo;t you think the best way is to venture for&rsquo;t twice!&rsquo;
  &lsquo;I advise,&rsquo; cries the lady, &lsquo;to try it, I own....
  Ah! the doctor is loo&rsquo;d! Come, doctor, put down.&rsquo;
  Thus, playing, and playing, I still grow more eager,
  And so bold, and so bold, I&rsquo;m at last a bold beggar.
  Now, ladies, I ask, if law-matters you&rsquo;re skill&rsquo;d in,
  Whether crimes such as yours should not come before Fielding:
  For giving advice that is not worth a straw,
  May well be call&rsquo;d picking of pockets in law;
  And picking of pockets, with which I now charge ye,
  Is, by quinto Elizabeth, Death without Clergy.
  What justice, when both to the Old Bailey brought!
  By the gods, I&rsquo;ll enjoy it, tho&rsquo; &rsquo;tis but in thought!
  Both are plac&rsquo;d at the bar, with all proper decorum,
  With bunches of fennel, and nosegays before &lsquo;em;
  Both cover their faces with mobs and all that,
  But the judge bids them, angrily, take off their hat.
  When uncover&rsquo;d, a buzz of inquiry runs round,
  &lsquo;Pray what are their crimes?&rsquo;... &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve been pilfering found.&rsquo;
  &lsquo;But, pray, who have they pilfer&rsquo;d?&rsquo;... &lsquo;A doctor, I hear.&rsquo;
  <i>&lsquo;What, yon solemn-faced, odd-looking man that stands near?&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
  &lsquo;The same.&rsquo;... &lsquo;What a pity! how does it surprise one,
  <i>Two handsomer culprits I never set eyes on!&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
  Then their friends all come round me with cringing and leering,
  To melt me to pity, and soften my swearing.
  First Sir Charles advances with phrases wellstrung,
  &lsquo;Consider, dear doctor, the girls are but young.&rsquo;
  &lsquo;The younger the worse,&rsquo; I return him again,
  &lsquo;It shows that their habits are all dyed in grain.&rsquo;
  &lsquo;But then they&rsquo;re so handsome, one&rsquo;s bosom it grieves.
  &lsquo;What signifies <i>handsome</i>, when people are thieves?&rsquo;
  &lsquo;But where is your justice? their cases are hard.&rsquo;
  &lsquo;What signifies <i>justice</i>? I want the <i>reward</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the parish of Edmonton offers forty pounds;
      there&rsquo;s the parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch offers forty pounds;
      there&rsquo;s the parish of Tyburn, from the Hog-in-the-pound to St. Giles&rsquo;
      watch-house, offers forty pounds&mdash;I shall have all that if I convict
      them!&rsquo;&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;But consider their case,... it may yet be your own!
  And see how they kneel! Is your heart made of stone!&rsquo;
  This moves!... so at last I agree to relent,
  For ten pounds in hand, and ten pounds to be spent.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I challenge you all to answer this: I tell you, you cannot. It cuts
      deep. But now for the rest of the letter: and next&mdash;but I want room&mdash;so
      I believe I shall battle the rest out at Barton some day next week. I don&rsquo;t
      value you all!

      We regret that we have no record of this Christmas visit to Barton; that
      the poet had no Boswell to follow at his heels, and take note of all his
      sayings and doings. We can only picture him in our minds, casting off all
      care; enacting the lord of misrule; presiding at the Christmas revels;
      providing all kinds of merriment; keeping the card-table in an uproar, and
      finally opening the ball on the first day of the year in his spring-velvet
      suit, with the Jessamy Bride for a partner.

    </p>
    <p>
      The gay life depicted in the two last chapters, while it kept Goldsmith in
      a state of continual excitement, aggravated the malady which was impairing
      his constitution; yet his increasing perplexities in money matters drove
      him to the dissipation of society as a relief from solitary care. The
      delays of the theater added to those perplexities. He had long since
      finished his new comedy, yet the year 1772 passed away without his being
      able to get it on the stage. No one, uninitiated in the interior of a
      theater, that little world of traps and trickery, can have any idea of the
      obstacles and perplexities multiplied in the way of the most eminent and
      successful author by the mismanagement of managers, the jealousies and
      intrigues of rival authors, and the fantastic and impertinent caprices of
      actors. A long and baffling negotiation was carried on between Goldsmith
      and Colman, the manager of Covent Garden; who retained the play in his
      hands until the middle of January (1773), without coming to a decision.
      The theatrical season was rapidly passing away, and Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      pecuniary difficulties were augmenting and pressing on him. We may judge
      of his anxiety by the following letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>To George Colman, Esq.</i>

    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR&mdash;I entreat you&rsquo;ll relieve me from that state of
      suspense in which I have been kept for a long time. Whatever objections
      you have made or shall make to my play, I will endeavor to remove and not
      argue about them. To bring in any new judges, either of its merits or
      faults, I can never submit to. Upon a former occasion, when my other play
      was before Mr. Garrick, he offered to bring me before Mr. Whitehead&rsquo;s
      tribunal, but I refused the proposal with indignation: I hope I shall not
      experience as harsh treatment from you as from him. I have, as you know, a
      large sum of money to make up shortly; by accepting my play, I can readily
      satisfy my creditor that way; at any rate, I must look about to some
      certainty to be prepared. For God&rsquo;s sake take the play, and let us
      make the best of it, and let me have the same measure, at least, which you
      have given as bad plays as mine. I am your friend and servant,
    </p>

      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Colman returned the manuscript with the blank sides of the leaves scored
      with disparaging comments and suggested alterations, but with the
      intimation that the faith of the theater should be kept, and the play
      acted notwithstanding. Goldsmith submitted the criticisms to some of his
      friends, who pronounced them trivial, unfair, and contemptible, and
      intimated that Colman, being a dramatic writer himself, might be actuated
      by jealousy. The play was then sent, with Colman&rsquo;s comments written
      on it, to Garrick; but he had scarce sent it when Johnson interfered,
      represented the evil that might result from an apparent rejection of it by
      Covent Garden, and undertook to go forthwith to Colman, and have a talk
      with him on the subject. Goldsmith, therefore, penned the following note
      to Garrick:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR&mdash;I ask many pardons for the trouble I gave you
      yesterday. Upon more mature deliberation, and the advice of a sensible
      friend, I began to think it indelicate in me to throw upon you the odium
      of confirming Mr. Colman&rsquo;s sentence. I therefore request you will
      send my play back by my servant; for, having been assured of having it
      acted at the other house, though I confess yours in every respect more to
      my wish, yet it would be folly in me to forego an advantage which lies in
      my power of appealing from Mr. Colman&rsquo;s opinion to the judgment of
      the town. I entreat, if not too late, you will keep this affair a secret
      for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, dear sir, your very humble servant,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      The negotiation of Johnson with the manager of Covent Garden was
      effective. &ldquo;Colman,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was prevailed on at last,
      by much solicitation, nay, a kind of force,&rdquo; to bring forward the
      comedy. Still the manager was ungenerous; or, at least, indiscreet enough
      to express his opinion, that it would not reach a second representation.
      The plot, he said, was bad, and the interest not sustained; &ldquo;it
      dwindled, and dwindled, and at last went out like the snuff of a candle.&rdquo;
      The effect of his croaking was soon apparent within the walls of the
      theater. Two of the most popular actors, Woodward and Gentleman Smith, to
      whom the parts of Tony Lumpkin and Young Marlow were assigned, refused to
      act them; one of them alleging, in excuse, the evil predictions of the
      manager. Goldsmith was advised to postpone the performance of his play
      until he could get these important parts well supplied. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;I would sooner that my play were damned by bad players
      than merely saved by good acting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick was substituted for Woodward in Tony Lumpkin, and Lee Lewis, the
      harlequin of the theater, for Gentleman Smith in Young Marlow; and both
      did justice to their parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great interest was taken by Goldsmith&rsquo;s friends in the success of
      his piece. The rehearsals were attended by Johnson, Cradock, Murphy,
      Reynolds and his sister, and the whole Horneck connection, including, of
      course, the &ldquo;Jessamy Bride,&rdquo; whose presence may have
      contributed to flutter the anxious heart of the author. The rehearsals
      went off with great applause, but that Colman attributed to the partiality
      of friends. He continued to croak, and refused to risk any expense in new
      scenery or dresses on a play which he was sure would prove a failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time was at hand for the first representation, and as yet the comedy
      was without a title. &ldquo;We are all in labor for a name for Goldy&rsquo;s
      play,&rdquo; said Johnson, who, as usual, took a kind of fatherly
      protecting interest in poor Goldsmith&rsquo;s affairs. The Old House a New
      Inn was thought of for a time, but still did not please. Sir Joshua
      Reynolds proposed The Belle&rsquo;s Stratagem, an elegant title, but not
      considered applicable, the perplexities of the comedy being produced by
      the mistake of the hero, not the stratagem of the heroine. The name was
      afterward adopted by Mrs. Cowley for one of her comedies. The Mistakes of
      a Night was the title at length fixed upon, to which Goldsmith prefixed
      the words She Stoops to Conquer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil bodings of Colman still continued; they were even communicated in
      the box office to the servant of the Duke of Gloucester, who was sent to
      engage a box. Never did the play of a popular writer struggle into
      existence through more difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Foote&rsquo;s Primitive Puppet-show, entitled the Handsome
      Housemaid, or Piety on Pattens, had been brought out at the Haymarket on
      the 15th of February. All the world, fashionable and unfashionable, had
      crowded to the theater. The street was thronged with equipages&mdash;the
      doors were stormed by the mob. The burlesque was completely successful,
      and sentimental comedy received its quietus. Even Garrick, who had
      recently befriended it, now gave it a kick, as he saw it going down hill,
      and sent Goldsmith a humorous prologue to help his comedy of the opposite
      school. Garrick and Goldsmith, however, were now on very cordial terms, to
      which the social meetings in the circle of the Hornecks and Bunburys may
      have contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 15th of March the new comedy was to be performed. Those who had
      stood up for its merits, and been irritated and disgusted by the treatment
      it had received from the manager, determined to muster their forces, and
      aid in giving it a good launch upon the town. The particulars of this
      confederation, and of its triumphant success, are amusingly told by
      Cumberland in his memoirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were not over-sanguine of success, but perfectly determined to
      struggle hard for our author. We accordingly assembled our strength at the
      Shakespeare Tavern, in a considerable body, for an early dinner, where
      Samuel Johnson took the chair at the head of a long table, and was the
      life and soul of the corps: the poet took post silently by his side, with
      the Burkes, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Fitzherbert, Caleb Whitefoord, and a
      phalanx of North British, predetermined applauders, under the banner of
      Major Mills, all good men and true. Our illustrious president was in
      inimitable glee; and poor Goldsmith that day took all his raillery as
      patiently and complacently as my friend Boswell would have done any day or
      every day of his life. In the meantime, we did not forget our duty; and
      though we had a better comedy going, in which Johnson was chief actor, we
      betook ourselves in good time to our separate and allotted posts, and
      waited the awful drawing up of the curtain. As our stations were
      preconcerted, so were our signals for plaudits arranged and determined
      upon in a manner that gave every one his cue where to look for them, and
      how to follow them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had among us a very worthy and efficient member, long since lost
      to his friends and the world at large, Adam Drummond, of amiable memory,
      who was gifted by nature with the most sonorous, and, at the same time,
      the most contagious laugh that ever echoed from the human lungs. The
      neighing of the horse of the son of Hystaspes was a whisper to it; the
      whole thunder of the theater could not drown it. This kind and ingenious
      friend fairly forewarned us that he knew no more when to give his fire
      than the cannon did that was planted on a battery. He desired, therefore,
      to have a flapper at his elbow, and I had the honor to be deputed to that
      office. I planted him in an upper box, pretty nearly over the stage, in
      full view of the pit and galleries, and perfectly well situated to give
      the echo all its play through the hollows and recesses of the theater. The
      success of our maneuver was complete. All eyes were upon Johnson, who sat
      in a front row of a side box; and when he laughed, everybody thought
      themselves warranted to roar. In the meantime, my friend followed signals
      with a rattle so irresistibly comic that, when he had repeated it several
      times, the attention of the spectators was so engrossed by his person and
      performances that the progress of the play seemed likely to become a
      secondary object, and I found it prudent to insinuate to him that he might
      halt his music without any prejudice to the author; but alas! it was now
      too late to rein him in; he had laughed upon my signal where he found no
      joke, and now, unluckily, he fancied that he found a joke in almost
      everything that was said; so that nothing in nature could be more
      malapropos than some of his bursts every now and then were. These were
      dangerous moments, for the pit began to take umbrage; but we carried our
      point through, and triumphed not only over Colman&rsquo;s judgment, but
      our own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of this statement has been condemned as exaggerated or discolored.
      Cumberland&rsquo;s memoirs have generally been characterized as partaking
      of romance, and in the present instance he had particular motives for
      tampering with the truth. He was a dramatic writer himself, jealous of the
      success of a rival, and anxious to have it attributed to the private
      management of friends. According to various accounts, public and private,
      such management was unnecessary, for the piece was &ldquo;received
      throughout with the greatest acclamations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith, in the present instance, had not dared, as on a former
      occasion, to be present at the first performance. He had been so overcome
      by his apprehensions that, at the preparatory dinner he could hardly utter
      a word, and was so choked that he could not swallow a mouthful. When his
      friends trooped to the theater, he stole away to St. James&rsquo; Park:
      there he was found by a friend between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock,
      wandering up and down the Mall like a troubled spirit. With difficulty he
      was persuaded to go to the theater, where his presence might be important
      should any alteration be necessary. He arrived at the opening of the fifth
      act, and made his way behind the scenes. Just as he entered there was a
      slight hiss at the improbability of Tony Lumpkin&rsquo;s trick on his
      mother, in persuading her she was forty miles off, on Crackskull Common,
      though she had been trundled about on her own grounds. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      that? what&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; cried Goldsmith to the manager, in great
      agitation. &ldquo;Pshaw! doctor,&rdquo; replied Colman, sarcastically,
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be frightened at a squib, when we&rsquo;ve been sitting
      these two hours on a barrel of gunpowder!&rdquo; Though of a most
      forgiving nature Goldsmith did not easily forget this ungracious and
      ill-timed sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Colman was indeed actuated by the paltry motives ascribed to him in his
      treatment of this play, he was most amply punished by its success, and by
      the taunts, epigrams, and censures leveled at him through the press, in
      which his false prophecies were jeered at; his critical judgment called in
      question; and he was openly taxed with literary jealousy. So galling and
      unremitting was the fire, that he at length wrote to Goldsmith, entreating
      him &ldquo;to take him off the rack of the newspapers&rdquo;; in the
      meantime, to escape the laugh that was raised about him in the theatrical
      world of London, he took refuge in Bath during the triumphant career of
      the comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is one of the many squibs which assailed the ears of the
      manager:
    </p>
    <h3>
      TO GEORGE COLMAN, ESQ.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      ON THE SUCCESS OF DR. GOLDSMITH&rsquo;S NEW COMEDY
    </h3>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Come, Coley, doff those mourning weeds,
    Nor thus with jokes be flamm&rsquo;d;
  Tho&rsquo; Goldsmith&rsquo;s present play succeeds,
    His next may still be damn&rsquo;d.

 &ldquo;As this has &lsquo;scaped without a fall,
    To sink his next prepare;
  New actors hire from Wapping Wall,
    And dresses from Rag Fair.

 &ldquo;For scenes let tatter&rsquo;d blankets fly,
    The prologue Kelly write;
  Then swear again the piece must die
    Before the author&rsquo;s night.

 &ldquo;Should these tricks fail, the lucky elf,
    To bring to lasting shame,
  E&rsquo;en write <i>the best you can yourself</i>,
    And print it in <i>his name</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The solitary hiss, which had startled Goldsmith, was ascribed by some of
      the newspaper scribblers to Cumberland himself, who was &ldquo;manifestly
      miserable&rdquo; at the delight of the audience, or to Ossian Macpherson,
      who was hostile to the whole Johnson clique, or to Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      dramatic rival, Kelly. The following is one of the epigrams which
      appeared:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;At Dr. Goldsmith&rsquo;s merry play,
    All the spectators laugh, they say;
    The assertion, sir, I must deny,
    For Cumberland and Kelly cry.

  &ldquo;<i>Ride, si sapis</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Another, addressed to Goldsmith, alludes to Kelly&rsquo;s early
      apprenticeship to stay-making:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;If Kelly finds fault with the <i>shape</i> of your muse,
    And thinks that too loosely it plays,
  He surely, dear doctor, will never refuse
    To make it a new <i>Pair of Stays</i>!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Cradock had returned to the country before the production of the play; the
      following letter, written just after the performance, gives an additional
      picture of the thorns which beset an author in the path of theatrical
      literature:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR SIR&mdash;The play has met with a success much beyond your
      expectations or mine. I thank you sincerely for your epilogue, which,
      however, could not be used, but with your permission shall be printed. The
      story in short is this. Murphy sent me rather the outline of an epilogue
      than an epilogue, which was to be sung by Miss Catley, and which she
      approved; Mrs. Bulkley hearing this, insisted on throwing up her part&rdquo;
      (Miss Hardcastle) &ldquo;unless, according to the custom of the theater,
      she were permitted to speak the epilogue. In this embarrassment I thought
      of making a quarreling epilogue between Catley and her, debating <i>who</i>
      should speak the epilogue; but then Mrs. Catley refused after I had taken
      the trouble of drawing it out. I was then at a loss indeed; an epilogue
      was to be made, and for none but Mrs. Bulkley. I made one, and Colman
      thought it too bad to be spoken; I was obliged, therefore, to try a fourth
      time, and I made a very mawkish thing, as you&rsquo;ll shortly see. Such
      is the history of my stage adventures, and which I have at last done with.
      I cannot help saying that I am very sick of the stage; and though I
      believe I shall get three tolerable benefits, yet I shall, on the whole,
      be a loser, even in a pecuniary light; my ease and comfort I certainly
      lost while it was in agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, my dear Cradock, your obliged and obedient servant, OLIVER
      GOLDSMITH.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Present my most humble respects to Mrs. Cradock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson, who had taken such a conspicuous part in promoting the interests
      of poor &ldquo;Goldy,&rdquo; was triumphant at the success of the piece.
      &ldquo;I know of no comedy for many years,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that has
      so much exhilarated an audience; that has answered so much the great end
      of comedy&mdash;making an audience merry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith was happy, also, in gleaning applause from less authoritative
      sources. Northcote, the painter, then a youthful pupil of Sir Joshua
      Reynolds; and Ralph, Sir Joshua&rsquo;s confidential man, had taken their
      stations in the gallery to lead the applause in that quarter. Goldsmith
      asked Northcote&rsquo;s opinion of the play. The youth modestly declared
      he could not presume to judge in such matters. &ldquo;Did it make you
      laugh?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh. exceedingly!&rdquo; &ldquo;That is all I require,&rdquo;
      replied Goldsmith; and rewarded him for his criticism by box-tickets for
      his first benefit night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comedy was immediately put to press, and dedicated to Johnson in the
      following grateful and affectionate terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In inscribing this slight performance to you, I do not mean so much
      to compliment you as myself. It may do me some honor to inform the public
      that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may serve the
      interests of mankind also to inform them that the greatest wit may be
      found in a character, without impairing the most unaffected piety.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The copyright was transferred to Mr. Newbery, according to agreement,
      whose profits on the sale of the work far exceeded the debts for which the
      author in his perplexities had pre-engaged it. The sum which accrued to
      Goldsmith from his benefit nights afforded but a slight palliation of his
      pecuniary difficulties. His friends, while they exulted in his success,
      little knew of his continually increasing embarrassments, and of the
      anxiety of mind which kept tasking his pen while it impaired the ease and
      freedom of spirit necessary to felicitous composition.

    <h3>
      A NEWSPAPER ATTACK&mdash;THE EVANS AFFRAY&mdash;JOHNSON&rsquo;S COMMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The triumphant success of She Stoops to Conquer brought forth, of course,
      those carpings and cavilings of underling scribblers which are the thorns
      and briers in the path of successful authors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith, though easily nettled by attacks of the kind, was at present
      too well satisfied with the reception of his comedy to heed them; but the
      following anonymous letter, which appeared in a public paper, was not to
      be taken with equal equanimity:
    </p>
    <h3>
      [FOR THE LONDON PACKET.]
    </h3>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;TO DR. GOLDSMITH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Vous vous noyez par vanité</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR&mdash;The happy knack which you have learned of puffing your
      own compositions, provokes me to come forth. You have not been the editor
      of newspapers and magazines not to discover the trick of literary <i>humbug</i>;
      but the gauze is so thin that the very foolish part of the world see
      through it, and discover the doctor&rsquo;s monkey face and cloven foot.
      Your poetic vanity is as unpardonable as your personal. Would man believe
      it, and will woman bear it, to be told that for hours the great Goldsmith
      will stand surveying his grotesque orang-outang&rsquo;s figure in a
      pier-glass? Was but the lovely H&mdash;k as much enamored, you would not
      sigh, my gentle swain, in vain. But your vanity is preposterous. How will
      this same bard of Bedlam ring the changes in the praise of Goldy! But what
      has he to be either proud or vain of? The Traveler is a flimsy poem, built
      upon false principles&mdash;principles diametrically opposite to liberty.
      What is The Good-Natured Man but a poor, water-gruel dramatic dose? What
      is The Deserted Village but a pretty poem of easy numbers, without fancy,
      dignity, genius, or fire? And, pray, what may be the last <i>speaking
      pantomime</i>, so praised by the doctor himself, but an incoherent piece
      of stuff, the figure of a woman with a fish&rsquo;s tail, without plot,
      incident, or intrigue? We are made to laugh at stale, dull jokes, wherein
      we mistake pleasantry for wit, and grimace for humor; wherein every scene
      is unnatural and inconsistent with the rules, the laws of nature and of
      the drama; viz., two gentlemen come to a man of fortune&rsquo;s house,
      eat, drink, etc., and take it for an inn. The one is intended as a lover
      for the daughter; he talks with her for some hours; and, when he sees her
      again in a different dress, he treats her as a bar-girl, and swears she
      squinted. He abuses the master of the house, and threatens to kick him out
      of his own doors. The squire, whom we are told is to be a fool, proves to
      be the most sensible being of the piece; and he makes out a whole act by
      bidding his mother lie close behind a bush, persuading her that his
      father, her own husband, is a highwayman, and that he has come to cut
      their throats; and, to give his cousin an opportunity to go off, he drives
      his mother over hedges, ditches, and through ponds. There is not, sweet,
      sucking Johnson, a natural stroke in the whole play but the young fellow&rsquo;s
      giving the stolen jewels to the mother, supposing her to be the landlady.
      That Mr. Colman did no justice to this piece, I honestly allow; that he
      told all his friends it would be damned, I positively aver; and, from such
      ungenerous insinuations, without a dramatic merit, it rose to public
      notice, and it is now the ton to go and see it, though I never saw a
      person that either liked it or approved it, any more than the absurd plot
      of Home&rsquo;s tragedy of Alonzo. Mr. Goldsmith, correct your arrogance,
      reduce your vanity, and endeavor to believe, as a man, you are of the
      plainest sort; and as an author, but a mortal piece of mediocrity.

    <p>
      It would be difficult to devise a letter more calculated to wound the
      peculiar sensibilities of Goldsmith. The attacks upon him as an author,
      though annoying enough, he could have tolerated; but then the allusion to
      his &ldquo;grotesque&rdquo; person, to his studious attempts to adorn it;
      and, above all, to his being an unsuccessful admirer of the lovely H&mdash;k
      (the Jessamy Bride), struck rudely upon the most sensitive part of his
      highly sensitive nature. The paragraph, it was said, was first pointed out
      to him by an officious friend, an Irishman, who told him he was bound in
      honor to resent it; but he needed no such prompting. He was in a high
      state of excitement and indignation, and accompanied by his friend, who is
      said to have been a Captain Higgins, of the marines, he repaired to
      Paternoster Row, to the shop of Evans, the publisher, whom he supposed to
      be the editor of the paper. Evans was summoned by his shopman from an
      adjoining room. Goldsmith announced his name. &ldquo;I have called,&rdquo;
      added he, &ldquo;in consequence of a scurrilous attack made upon me, and
      an unwarrantable liberty taken with the name of a young lady. As for
      myself, I care little; but her name must not be sported with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Evans professed utter ignorance of the matter, and said he would speak to
      the editor. He stooped to examine a file of the paper, in search of the
      offensive article; whereupon Goldsmith&rsquo;s friend gave him a signal,
      that now was a favorable moment for the exercise of his cane. The hint was
      taken as quick as given, and the cane was vigorously applied to the back
      of the stooping publisher. The latter rallied in an instant, and, being a
      stout, high-blooded Welshman, returned the blows with interest. A lamp
      hanging overhead was broken, and sent down a shower of oil upon the
      combatants; but the battle raged with unceasing fury. The shopman ran off
      for a constable; but Dr. Kenrick, who happened to be in the adjacent room,
      sallied forth, interfered between the combatants, and put an end to the
      affray. He conducted Goldsmith to a coach, in exceedingly battered and
      tattered plight, and accompanied him home, soothing him with much mock
      commiseration, though he was generally suspected, and on good grounds, to
      be the author of the libel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evans immediately instituted a suit against Goldsmith for an assault, but
      was ultimately prevailed upon to compromise the matter, the poet
      contributing fifty pounds to the Welsh charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Newspapers made themselves, as may well be supposed, exceedingly merry
      with the combat. Some censured him severely for invading the sanctity of a
      man&rsquo;s own house; others accused him of having, in his former
      capacity of editor of a magazine, been guilty of the very offenses that he
      now resented in others. This drew from him the following vindication:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>To the Public</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lest it should be supposed that I have been willing to correct in
      others an abuse of which I have been guilty myself, I beg leave to
      declare, that, in all my life, I never wrote or dictated a single
      paragraph, letter, or essay in a newspaper, except a few moral essays
      under the character of a Chinese, about ten years ago, in the &lsquo;Ledger,&rsquo;
      and a letter, to which I signed my name in the &lsquo;St. James&rsquo;
      Chronicle.&rsquo; If the liberty of the press, therefore, has been abused,
      I have had no hand in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always considered the press as the protector of our freedom,
      as a watchful guardian, capable of uniting the weak against the
      encroachments of power. What concerns the public most properly admits of a
      public discussion. But, of late, the press has turned from defending
      public interest to making inroads upon private life; from combating the
      strong to overwhelming the feeble. No condition is now too obscure for its
      abuse, and the protector has become the tyrant of the people. In this
      manner the freedom of the press is beginning to sow the seeds of its own
      dissolution; the great must oppose it from principle, and the weak from
      fear; till at last every rank of mankind shall be found to give up its
      benefits, content with security from insults.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How to put a stop to this licentiousness, by which all are
      indiscriminately abused, and by which vice consequently escapes in the
      general censure, I am unable to tell; all I could wish is that, as the law
      gives us no protection against the injury, so it should give calumniators
      no shelter after having provoked correction. The insults which we receive
      before the public, by being more open, are the more distressing; by
      treating them with silent contempt we do not pay a sufficient deference to
      the opinion of the world. By recurring to legal redress we too often
      expose the weakness of the law, which only serves to increase our
      mortification by failing to relieve us. In short, every man should singly
      consider himself as the guardian of the liberty of the press, and, as far
      as his influence can extend, should endeavor to prevent its licentiousness
      becoming at last the grave of its freedom.
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      Boswell, who had just arrived in town, met with this article in a
      newspaper which he found at Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s. The doctor was from home
      at the time, and Bozzy and Mrs. Williams, in a critical conference over
      the letter, determined from the style that it must have been written by
      the lexicographer himself. The latter on his return soon undeceived them.
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to Boswell, &ldquo;Goldsmith would no more have
      asked me to have wrote such a thing as that for him than he would have
      asked me to feed him with a spoon, or do anything else that denoted his
      imbecility. Sir, had he shown it to any one friend, he would not have been
      allowed to publish it. He has, indeed, done it very well; but it is a
      foolish thing well done. I suppose he has been so much elated with the
      success of his new comedy that he has thought everything that concerned
      him must be of importance to the public.&rdquo;

      SUBSERVIENCY
    </p>
    <p>
      The return of Boswell to town to his task of noting down the conversations
      of Johnson enables us to glean from his journal some scanty notices of
      Goldsmith. It was now Holy Week, a time during which Johnson was
      particularly solemn in his manner and strict in his devotions. Boswell,
      who was the imitator of the great moralist in everything, assumed, of
      course, an extra devoutness on the present occasion. &ldquo;He had an odd
      mock solemnity of tone and manner,&rdquo; said Miss Burney (afterward
      Madame D&rsquo;Arblay), &ldquo;which he had acquired from constantly
      thinking, and imitating Dr. Johnson.&rdquo; It would seem, that he
      undertook to deal out some secondhand homilies, <i>à la Johnson</i>, for
      the edification of Goldsmith during Holy Week. The poet, whatever might be
      his religious feeling, had no disposition to be schooled by so shallow an
      apostle. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he in reply, &ldquo;as I take my shoes
      from the shoemaker, and my coat from the tailor, so I take my religion
      from the priest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell treasured up the reply in his memory or his memorandum book. A few
      days afterward, the 9th of April, he kept Good Friday with Dr. Johnson, in
      orthodox style; breakfasted with him on tea and crossbuns; went to church
      with him morning and evening; fasted in the interval, and read with him in
      the Greek Testament; then, in the piety of his heart, complained of the
      sore rebuff he had met with in the course of his religious exhortations to
      the poet, and lamented that the latter should indulge in &ldquo;this loose
      way of talking.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;Goldsmith
      knows nothing&mdash;he has made up his mind about nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This reply seems to have gratified the lurking jealousy of Boswell, and he
      has recorded it in his journal. Johnson, however, with respect to
      Goldsmith, and indeed with respect to everybody else, blew hot as well as
      cold, according to the humor he was in. Boswell, who was astonished and
      piqued at the continually increasing celebrity of the poet, observed some
      time after to Johnson, in a tone of surprise, that Goldsmith had acquired
      more fame than all the officers of the last war who were not generals.
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; answered Johnson, his old feeling of good-will
      working uppermost, &ldquo;you will find ten thousand fit to do what they
      did, before you find one to do what Goldsmith has done. You must consider
      that a thing is valued according to its rarity. A pebble that paves the
      street is in itself more useful than the diamond upon a lady&rsquo;s
      finger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 13th of April we find Goldsmith and Johnson at the table of old
      General Oglethorpe, discussing the question of the degeneracy of the human
      race. Goldsmith asserts the fact, and attributes it to the influence of
      luxury. Johnson denies the fact; and observes that, even admitting it,
      luxury could not be the cause. It reached but a small proportion of the
      human race. Soldiers, on sixpence a day, could not indulge in luxuries;
      the poor and laboring classes, forming the great mass of mankind, were out
      of its sphere. Wherever it could reach them, it strengthened them and
      rendered them prolific. The conversation was not of particular force or
      point as reported by Boswell; the dinner party was a very small one, in
      which there was no provocation to intellectual display.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner they took tea with the ladies, where we find poor Goldsmith
      happy and at home, singing Tony Lumpkin&rsquo;s song of the Three Jolly
      Pigeons, and another called the Humors of Ballamaguery, to a very pretty
      Irish tune. It was to have been introduced in She Stoops to Conquer, but
      was left out, as the actress who played the heroine could not sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in these genial moments that the sunshine of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      nature would break out, and he would say and do a thousand whimsical and
      agreeable things that made him the life of the strictly social circle.
      Johnson, with whom conversation was everything, used to judge Goldsmith
      too much by his own colloquial standard, and undervalue him for being less
      provided than himself with acquired facts, the ammunition of the tongue
      and often the mere lumber of the memory; others, however, valued him for
      the native felicity of his thoughts, however carelessly expressed, and for
      certain good-fellow qualities, less calculated to dazzle than to endear.
      &ldquo;It is amazing,&rdquo; said Johnson one day, after he himself had
      been talking like an oracle; &ldquo;it is amazing how little Goldsmith
      knows; he seldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one else.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; replied Sir Joshua Reynolds, with affectionate
      promptness, &ldquo;there is no man whose company is more <i>liked</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three days after the dinner at General Oglethorpe&rsquo;s,
      Goldsmith met Johnson again at the table of General Paoli, the hero of
      Corsica. Martinelli, of Florence, author of an Italian History of England,
      was among the guests; as was Boswell, to whom we are indebted for minutes
      of the conversation which took place. The question was debated whether
      Martinelli should continue his history down to that day. &ldquo;To be sure
      he should,&rdquo; said Goldsmith. &ldquo;No, sir;&rdquo; cried Johnson,
      &ldquo;it would give great offense. He would have to tell of almost all
      the living great what they did not wish told.&rdquo; Goldsmith.&mdash;&ldquo;It
      may, perhaps, be necessary for a native to be more cautious; but a
      foreigner, who comes among us without prejudice, may be considered as
      holding the place of a judge, and may speak his mind freely.&rdquo;
      Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, a foreigner, when he sends a work from the
      press, ought to be on his guard against catching the error and mistaken
      enthusiasm of the people among whom he happens to be.&rdquo; Goldsmith.&mdash;&ldquo;Sir,
      he wants only to sell his history, and to tell truth; one an honest, the
      other a laudable motive.&rdquo; Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, they are both
      laudable motives. It is laudable in a man to wish to live by his labors;
      but he should write so as he may live by them, not so as he may be knocked
      on the head. I would advise him to be at Calais before he publishes his
      history of the present age. A foreigner who attaches himself to a
      political party in this country is in the worst state that can be
      imagined; he is looked upon as a mere intermeddler. A native may do it
      from interest.&rdquo; Boswell.&mdash;&ldquo;Or principle.&rdquo;
      Goldsmith.&mdash;&ldquo;There are people who tell a hundred political lies
      every day, and are not hurt by it. Surely, then, one may tell truth with
      perfect safety.&rdquo; Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;Why, sir, in the first place,
      he who tells a hundred lies has disarmed the force of his lies. But,
      besides, a man had rather have a hundred lies told of him than one truth
      which he does not wish to be told.&rdquo; Goldsmith.&mdash;&ldquo;For my
      part, I&rsquo;d tell the truth, and shame the devil.&rdquo; Johnson.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
      sir, but the devil will be angry. I wish to shame the devil as much as you
      do, but I should choose to be out of the reach of his claws.&rdquo;
      Goldsmith.&mdash;&ldquo;His claws can do you no hurt where you have the
      shield of truth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This last reply was one of Goldsmith&rsquo;s lucky hits, and closed the
      argument in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked,&rdquo; writes Boswell, &ldquo;of the king&rsquo;s coming
      to see Goldsmith&rsquo;s new play.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wish he would,&rdquo;
      said Goldsmith, adding, however, with an affected indifference, &ldquo;Not
      that it would do me the least good.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; cried
      Johnson, laughing, &ldquo;let us say it would do <i>him</i> good. No, sir,
      this affectation will not pass; it is mighty idle. In such a state as
      ours, who would not wish to please the chief magistrate?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> wish to please him,&rdquo; rejoined Goldsmith. &ldquo;I
      remember a line in Dryden:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;And every poet is the monarch&rsquo;s friend,&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;it ought to be reversed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Johnson,
      &ldquo;there are finer lines in Dryden on this subject:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;&lsquo;For colleges on bounteous kings depend,
   And never rebel was to arts a friend.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      General Paoli observed that &ldquo;successful rebels might be.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;Happy rebellions,&rdquo; interjected Martinelli. &ldquo;We have no
      such phrase,&rdquo; cried Goldsmith. &ldquo;But have you not the thing?&rdquo;
      asked Paoli. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith, &ldquo;all our <i>happy</i>
      revolutions. They have hurt our constitution, and <i>will</i> hurt it,
      till we mend it by another HAPPY REVOLUTION.&rdquo; This was a sturdy
      sally of Jacobitism that quite surprised Boswell, but must have been
      relished by Johnson.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Paoli mentioned a passage in the play, which had been construed
      into a compliment to a lady of distinction, whose marriage with the Duke
      of Cumberland had excited the strong disapprobation of the king as a
      mesalliance. Boswell, to draw Goldsmith out, pretended to think the
      compliment unintentional. The poet smiled and hesitated. The general came
      to his relief. &ldquo;Monsieur Goldsmith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;est comme
      la mer, qui jette des perles et beaucoup d&rsquo;autres belles choses,
      sans s&rsquo;en appercevoir&rdquo; (Mr. Goldsmith is like the sea, which
      casts forth pearls and many other beautiful things without perceiving it).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Très-bien dit, et très-elegamment&rdquo; (very well said, and very
      elegantly), exclaimed Goldsmith; delighted with so beautiful a compliment
      from such a quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson spoke disparagingly of the learning of a Mr. Harris, of Salisbury,
      and doubted his being a good Grecian. &ldquo;He is what is much better,&rdquo;
      cried Goldsmith, with a prompt good-nature, &ldquo;he is a worthy, humane
      man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the logical Johnson, &ldquo;that
      is not to the purpose of our argument; that will prove that he can play
      upon the fiddle as well as Giardini, as that he is an eminent Grecian.&rdquo;
      Goldsmith found he had got into a scrape, and seized upon Giardini to help
      him out of it. &ldquo;The greatest musical performers,&rdquo; said he,
      dexterously turning the conversation, &ldquo;have but small emoluments;
      Giardini, I am told, does not get above seven hundred a year.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;That is indeed but little for a man to get,&rdquo; observed
      Johnson, &ldquo;who does best that which so many endeavor to do. There is
      nothing, I think, in which the power of art is shown so much as in playing
      on the fiddle. In all other things we can do something at first. Any man
      will forge a bar of iron, if you give him a hammer; not so well as a
      smith, but tolerably. A man will saw a piece of wood, and make a box,
      though a clumsy one; but give him a fiddle and fiddlestick, and he can do
      nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This, upon the whole, though reported by the one-sided Boswell, is a
      tolerable specimen of the conversations of Goldsmith and Johnson; the
      farmer heedless, often illogical, always on the kind-hearted side of the
      question, and prone to redeem himself by lucky hits; the latter closely
      argumentative, studiously sententious, often profound, and sometimes
      laboriously prosaic.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had an argument a few days later at Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s table, on the
      subject of suicide. &ldquo;Do you think, sir,&rdquo; said Boswell, &ldquo;that
      all who commit suicide are mad?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson,
      &ldquo;they are not often universally disordered in their intellects, but
      one passion presses so upon them that they yield to it, and commit
      suicide, as a passionate man will stab another. I have often thought,&rdquo;
      added he, &ldquo;that after a man has taken the resolution to kill
      himself, it is not courage in him to do anything, however desperate,
      because he has nothing to fear.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that,&rdquo;
      observed Goldsmith. &ldquo;Nay, but, my dear sir,&rdquo; rejoined Johnson,
      &ldquo;why should you not see what every one else does?&rdquo; &ldquo;It
      is,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith, &ldquo;for fear of something that he has
      resolved to kill himself; and will not that timid disposition restrain
      him?&rdquo; &ldquo;It does not signify,&rdquo; pursued Johnson, &ldquo;that
      the fear of something made him resolve; it is upon the state of his mind,
      after the resolution is taken, that I argue. Suppose a man, either from
      fear, or pride, or conscience, or whatever motive, has resolved to kill
      himself; when once the resolution is taken he has nothing to fear. He may
      then go and take the King of Prussia by the nose at the head of his army.
      He cannot fear the rack who is determined to kill himself.&rdquo; Boswell
      reports no more of the discussion, though Goldsmith might have continued
      it with advantage; for the very timid disposition, which, through fear of
      something, was impelling the man to commit suicide, might restrain him
      from an act involving the punishment of the rack, more terrible to him
      than death itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be regretted in all these reports by Boswell we have scarcely
      anything but the remarks of Johnson; it is only by accident that he now
      and then gives us the observations of others, when they are necessary to
      explain or set off those of his hero. &ldquo;When in <i>that presence</i>,&rdquo;
      says Miss Burney, &ldquo;he was unobservant, if not contemptuous of every
      one else. In truth, when he met with Dr. Johnson, he commonly forbore even
      answering anything that was said, or attending to anything that went
      forward, lest he should miss the smallest sound from that voice, to which
      he paid such exclusive, though merited, homage. But the moment that voice
      burst forth, the attention which it excited on Mr. Boswell amounted almost
      to pain. His eyes goggled with eagerness; he leaned his ear almost on the
      shoulder of the doctor; and his mouth dropped open to catch every syllable
      that might be uttered; nay, he seemed not only to dread losing a word, but
      to be anxious not to miss a breathing; as if hoping from it latently, or
      mystically, some information.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion the doctor detected Boswell, or Bozzy, as he called him,
      eavesdropping behind his chair, as he was conversing with Miss Burney at
      Mr. Thrale&rsquo;s table. &ldquo;What are you doing there, sir?&rdquo;
      cried he, turning round angrily, and clapping his hand upon his knee.
      &ldquo;Go to the table, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell obeyed with an air of affright and submission, which raised a
      smile on every face. Scarce had he taken his seat, however, at a distance,
      than, impatient to get again at the side of Johnson, he rose and was
      running off in quest of something to show him, when the doctor roared
      after him authoritatively, &ldquo;What are you thinking of, sir? Why do
      you get up before the cloth is removed? Come back to your place, sir&rdquo;&mdash;and
      the obsequious spaniel did as he was commanded. &ldquo;Running about in
      the middle of meals!&rdquo; muttered the doctor, pursing his mouth at the
      same time to restrain his rising risibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boswell got another rebuff from Johnson, which would have demolished any
      other man. He had been teasing him with many direct questions, such as
      What did you do, sir? What did you say, sir? until the great philologist
      became perfectly enraged. &ldquo;I will not be put to the <i>question!</i>&rdquo;
      roared he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you consider, sir, that these are not the
      manners of a gentleman? I will not be baited with <i>what</i> and <i>why;</i>
      What is this? What is that? Why is a cow&rsquo;s tail long? Why is a fox&rsquo;s
      tail bushy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; replied pil-garlick, &ldquo;you
      are so good that I venture to trouble you,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      replied Johnson, &ldquo;my being so <i>good</i> is no reason why you
      should be so <i>ill</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;You have but two topics, sir,&rdquo;
      exclaimed he on another occasion, &ldquo;yourself and me, and I am sick of
      both.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Boswell&rsquo;s inveterate disposition to <i>toad</i> was a sore cause of
      mortification to his father, the old laird of Auchinleck (or Affleck). He
      had been annoyed by his extravagant devotion to Paoli, but then he was
      something of a military hero; but this tagging at the heels of Dr.
      Johnson, whom he considered a kind of pedagogue, set his Scotch blood in a
      ferment. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae hope for Jamie, mon,&rdquo; said he to a
      friend; &ldquo;Jamie is gaen clean gyte. What do you think, mon? He&rsquo;s
      done wi&rsquo; Paoli; he&rsquo;s off wi&rsquo; the land-louping scoundrel
      of a Corsican; and whose tail do you think he has pinn&rsquo;d himself to
      now, mon? A <i>dominie</i> mon; an auld dominie: he keeped a schule, and
      cau&rsquo;d it an acaadamy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall show in the next chapter that Jamie&rsquo;s devotion to the
      dominie did not go unrewarded.

      CHAPTER FORTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      CHANGES IN THE LITERARY CLUB&mdash;JOHNSON&rsquo;S OBJECTION TO GARRICK&mdash;ELECTION
      OP BOSWELL
    </p>
    <p>
      The Literary Club (as we have termed the club in Gerard Street, though it
      took that name some time later) had now been in existence several years.
      Johnson was exceedingly chary at first of its exclusiveness, and opposed
      to its being augmented in number. Not long after its institution, Sir
      Joshua Reynolds was speaking of it to Garrick. &ldquo;I like it much,&rdquo;
      said little David, briskly; &ldquo;I think I shall be of you.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;When Sir Joshua mentioned this to Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; says Boswell,
      &ldquo;he was much displeased with the actor&rsquo;s conceit. &lsquo;<i>He&rsquo;ll
      be of us?</i>&rsquo; growled he. &lsquo;How does he know we will <i>permit</i>
      him? The first duke in England has no right to hold such language.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sir John Hawkins spoke favorably of Garrick&rsquo;s pretensions,
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Johnson, &ldquo;he will disturb us by his
      buffoonery.&rdquo; In the same spirit he declared to Mr. Thrale that if
      Garrick should apply for admission he would blackball him. &ldquo;Who,
      sir?&rdquo; exclaimed Thrale, with surprise; &ldquo;Mr. Garrick&mdash;your
      friend, your companion&mdash;blackball him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo;
      replied Johnson, &ldquo;I love my little David dearly&mdash;better than
      all or any of his flatterers do; but surely one ought to sit in a society
      like ours,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Unelbowed by a gamester, pimp, or player.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The exclusion from the club was a sore mortification to Garrick, though he
      bore it without complaining. He could not help continually to ask
      questions about it&mdash;what was going on there&mdash;whether he was ever
      the subject of conversation. By degrees the rigor of the club relaxed:
      some of the members grew negligent. Beauclerc lost his right of membership
      by neglecting to attend. On his marriage, however, with Lady Diana
      Spencer, daughter of the Duke of Marlborough, and recently divorced from
      Viscount Bolingbroke, he had claimed and regained his seat in the club.
      The number of members had likewise been augmented. The proposition to
      increase it originated with Goldsmith. &ldquo;It would give,&rdquo; he
      thought, &ldquo;an agreeable variety to their meetings; for there can be
      nothing new among us,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we have traveled over each
      other&rsquo;s minds.&rdquo; Johnson was piqued at the suggestion. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;you have not traveled over my mind, I promise you.&rdquo;
      Sir Joshua, less confident in the exhaustless fecundity of his mind, felt
      and acknowledged the force of Goldsmith&rsquo;s suggestion. Several new
      members, therefore, had been added; the first, to his great joy, was David
      Garrick. Goldsmith, who was now on cordial terms with him, had zealously
      promoted his election, and Johnson had given it his warm approbation.
      Another new member was Beauclerc&rsquo;s friend, Lord Charlemont; and a
      still more important one was Mr., afterward Sir William Jones, the famous
      Orientalist, at that time a young lawyer of the Temple and a distinguished
      scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the great astonishment of the club, Johnson now proposed his devoted
      follower, Boswell, as a member. He did it in a note addressed to
      Goldsmith, who presided on the evening of the 23d of April. The nomination
      was seconded by Beauclerc. According to the rules of the club, the ballot
      would take place at the next meeting (on the 30th); there was an
      intervening week, therefore, in which to discuss the pretensions of the
      candidate. We may easily imagine the discussions that took place. Boswell
      had made himself absurd in such a variety of ways, that the very idea of
      his admission was exceedingly irksome to some of the members. &ldquo;The
      honor of being elected into the Turk&rsquo;s Head Club,&rdquo; said the
      Bishop of St. Asaph, &ldquo;is not inferior to that of being
      representative of Westminster and Surrey.&rdquo; What had Boswell done to
      merit such an honor? What chance had he of gaining it? The answer was
      simple: he had been the persevering worshiper, if not sycophant of
      Johnson. The great lexicographer had a heart to be won by apparent
      affection; he stood forth authoritatively in support of his vassal. If
      asked to state the merits of the candidate, he summed them up in an
      indefinite but comprehensive word of his own coining; he was <i>clubable</i>.
      He moreover gave significant hints that if Boswell were kept out he should
      oppose the admission of any other candidate. No further opposition was
      made; in fact none of the members had been so fastidious and exclusive in
      regard to the club as Johnson himself; and if he were pleased, they were
      easily satisfied; besides, they knew that, with all his faults, Boswell
      was a cheerful companion, and possessed lively social qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday, when the ballot was to take place, Beauclerc gave a dinner, at
      his house in the Adelphi, where Boswell met several of the members who
      were favorable to his election. After dinner the latter adjourned to the
      club, leaving Boswell in company with Lady Di Beauclerc until the fate of
      his election should be known. He sat, he says, in a state of anxiety which
      even the charming conversation of Lady Di could not entirely dissipate. It
      was not long before tidings were brought of his election, and he was
      conducted to the place of meeting, where, besides the company he had met
      at dinner, Burke, Dr. Nugent, Garrick, Goldsmith, and Mr. William Jones
      were waiting to receive him. The club, notwithstanding all its learned
      dignity in the eyes of the world, could at times &ldquo;unbend and play
      the fool&rdquo; as well as less important bodies. Some of its jocose
      conversations have at times leaked out, and a society in which Goldsmith
      could venture to sing his song of &ldquo;an old woman tossed in a blanket,&rdquo;
      could not be so very staid in its gravity. We may suppose, therefore, the
      jokes that had been passing among the members while awaiting the arrival
      of Boswell. Beauclerc himself could not have repressed his disposition for
      a sarcastic pleasantry. At least we have a right to presume all this from
      the conduct of Dr. Johnson himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his gravity he possessed a deep fund of quiet humor, and felt a
      kind of whimsical responsibility to protect the club from the absurd
      propensities of the very questionable associate he had thus inflicted on
      them. Rising, therefore, as Boswell entered, he advanced with a very
      doctorial air, placed himself behind a chair, on which he leaned as on a
      desk or pulpit, and then delivered, <i>ex cathedra</i>, a mock solemn
      charge, pointing out the conduct expected from him as a good member of the
      club; what he was to do, and especially what he was to avoid; including in
      the latter, no doubt, all those petty, prying, questioning, gossiping,
      babbling habits which had so often grieved the spirit of the
      lexicographer. It is to be regretted that Boswell has never thought proper
      to note down the particulars of this charge, which, from the well known
      characters and positions of the parties, might have furnished a parallel
      to the noted charge of Launcelot Gobbo to his dog.

      CHAPTER FORTY-ONE

    <p>
      DINNER AT THE DILLYS&rsquo;&mdash;CONVERSATIONS ON NATURAL HISTORY&mdash;INTERMEDDLING
      OF BOSWELL&mdash;DISPUTE ABOUT TOLERATION&mdash;JOHNSON&rsquo;S REBUFF TO
      GOLDSMITH&mdash;HIS APOLOGY&mdash;MAN-WORSHIP&mdash;DOCTORS MAJOR AND
      MINOR&mdash;A FAREWELL VISIT
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after the serio-comic scene of the elevation of Boswell into
      the Literary Club, we find that indefatigable Biographer giving
      particulars of a dinner at the Dillys&rsquo;, booksellers, in the Poultry,
      at which he met Goldsmith and Johnson, with several other literary
      characters. His anecdotes of the conversation, of course, go to glorify
      Dr. Johnson; for, as he observes in his biography, &ldquo;His conversation
      alone, or what led to it, or was interwoven with it, is the business of
      this work.&rdquo; Still on the present, as on other occasions, he gives
      unintentional and perhaps unavoidable gleams of Goldsmith&rsquo;s good
      sense, which show that the latter only wanted a less prejudiced and more
      impartial reporter to put down the charge of colloquial incapacity so
      unjustly fixed upon him. The conversation turned upon the natural history
      of birds, a beautiful subject, on which the poet, from his recent studies,
      his habits of observation, and his natural tastes, must have talked with
      instruction and feeling; yet, though we have much of what Johnson said, we
      have only a casual remark or two of Goldsmith. One was on the migration of
      swallows, which he pronounced partial; &ldquo;the stronger ones,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;migrate, the others do not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson denied to the brute creation the faculty of reason. &ldquo;Birds,&rdquo;
      said he, &ldquo;build by instinct; they never improve; they build their
      first nest as well as any one they ever build.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yet we see,&rdquo;
      observed Goldsmith, &ldquo;if you take away a bird&rsquo;s nest with the
      eggs in it, she will make a slighter nest and lay again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo;
      replied Johnson, &ldquo;that is because at first she has full time, and
      makes her nest deliberately. In the case you mention, she is pressed to
      lay, and must, therefore, make her nest quickly, and consequently it will
      be slight.&rdquo; &ldquo;The nidification of birds,&rdquo; rejoined
      Goldsmith, &ldquo;is what is least known in natural history, though one of
      the most curious things in it.&rdquo; While conversation was going on in
      this placid, agreeable and instructive manner, the eternal meddler and
      busybody Boswell, must intrude, to put it in a brawl. The Dillys were
      dissenters; two of their guests were dissenting clergymen; another, Mr.
      Toplady, was a clergyman of the established church. Johnson, himself, was
      a zealous, uncompromising churchman. None but a marplot like Boswell would
      have thought, on such an occasion, and in such company, to broach the
      subject of religious toleration; but, as has been well observed, &ldquo;it
      was his perverse inclination to introduce subjects that he hoped would
      produce difference and debate.&rdquo; In the present instance he gamed his
      point. An animated dispute immediately arose in which, according to
      Boswell&rsquo;s report, Johnson monopolized the greater part of the
      conversation; not always treating the dissenting clergymen with the
      greatest courtesy, and even once wounding the feelings of the mild and
      amiable Bennet Langton by his harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith mingled a little in the dispute and with some advantage, but was
      cut short by flat contradictions when most in the right. He sat for a time
      silent but impatient under such overbearing dogmatism, though Boswell,
      with his usual misinterpretation, attributes his &ldquo;restless agitation&rdquo;
      to a wish to <i>get in and shine</i>. &ldquo;Finding himself excluded,&rdquo;
      continued Boswell, &ldquo;he had taken his hat to go away, but remained
      for a time with it in his hand, like a gamester, who, at the end of a long
      night, lingers for a little while to see if he can have a favorable
      opportunity to finish with success.&rdquo; Once he was beginning to speak
      when he was overpowered by the loud voice of Johnson, who was at the
      opposite end of the table, and did not perceive his attempt; whereupon he
      threw down, as it were, his hat and his argument, and, darting an angry
      glance at Johnson, exclaimed in a bitter tone, &ldquo;<i>Take it.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then one of the disputants was beginning to speak, when Johnson
      uttering some sound, as if about to interrupt him, Goldsmith, according to
      Boswell, seized the opportunity to vent his own <i>envy and spleen</i>
      under pretext of supporting another person. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to
      Johnson, &ldquo;the gentleman has heard you patiently for an hour; pray
      allow us now to hear him.&rdquo; It was a reproof in the lexicographer&rsquo;s
      own style, and he may have felt that he merited it; but he was not
      accustomed to be reproved. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he sternly, &ldquo;I
      was not interrupting the gentleman; I was only giving him a signal of my
      attention. Sir, <i>you are impertinent</i>.&rdquo; Goldsmith made no
      reply, but after some time went away, having another engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as Boswell was on the way with Johnson and Langton to the
      club, he seized the occasion to make some disparaging remarks on
      Goldsmith, which he thought would just then be acceptable to the great
      lexicographer. &ldquo;It was a pity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Goldsmith
      would, on every occasion, endeavor to shine, by which he so often exposed
      himself.&rdquo; Langton contrasted him with Addison, who, content with the
      fame of his writings, acknowledged himself unfit for conversation; and on
      being taxed by a lady with silence in company, replied, &ldquo;Madam, I
      have but ninepence in ready money, but I can draw for a thousand pounds.&rdquo;
      To this Boswell rejoined that Goldsmith had a great deal of gold in his
      cabinet, but was always taking out his purse. &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo;
      chuckled Johnson, &ldquo;and that so often an empty purse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Johnson arrived at the club, however, his angry feelings had
      subsided, and his native generosity and sense of justice had got the
      uppermost. He found Goldsmith in company with Burke, Garrick, and other
      members, but sitting silent and apart, &ldquo;brooding,&rdquo; as Boswell
      says, &ldquo;over the reprimand he had received.&rdquo; Johnson&rsquo;s
      good heart yearned toward him; and knowing his placable nature, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      make Goldsmith forgive me,&rdquo; whispered he; then, with a loud voice,
      &ldquo;Dr. Goldsmith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;something passed to-day where
      you and I dined&mdash;<i>I ask your pardon</i>.&rdquo; The ire of the poet
      was extinguished in an instant, and his grateful affection for the
      magnanimous though sometimes overbearing moralist rushed to his heart.
      &ldquo;It must be much from you, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I take
      ill!&rdquo; &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; adds Boswell, &ldquo;the difference was
      over, and they were on as easy terms as ever, and Goldsmith rattled away
      as usual.&rdquo; We do not think these stories tell to the poet&rsquo;s
      disadvantage, even though related by Boswell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith, with all his modesty, could not be ignorant of his proper
      merit; and must have felt annoyed at times at being undervalued and
      elbowed aside by light-minded or dull men, in their blind and exclusive
      homage to the literary autocrat. It was a fine reproof he gave to Boswell
      on one occasion, for talking of Johnson as entitled to the honor of
      exclusive superiority. &ldquo;Sir, you are for making a monarchy what
      should be a republic.&rdquo; On another occasion, when he was conversing
      in company with great vivacity, and apparently to the satisfaction of
      those around him, an honest Swiss, who sat near, one George Michael Moser,
      keeper of the Royal Academy, perceiving Dr. Johnson rolling himself as if
      about to speak, exclaimed, &ldquo;Stay, stay! Toctor Shonson is going to
      say something.&rdquo; &ldquo;And are you sure, sir,&rdquo; replied
      Goldsmith, sharply, &ldquo;that <i>you</i> can comprehend what he says?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This clever rebuke, which gives the main zest to the anecdote, is omitted
      by Boswell, who probably did not perceive the point of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He relates another anecdote of the kind, on the authority of Johnson
      himself. The latter and Goldsmith were one evening in company with the
      Rev. George Graham, a master of Eton, who, notwithstanding the sobriety of
      his cloth, had got intoxicated &ldquo;to about the pitch of looking at one
      man and talking to another.&rdquo; &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; cried he in an
      ecstasy of devotion and good-will, but goggling by mistake upon Goldsmith,
      &ldquo;I should be glad to see you at Eton.&rdquo; &ldquo;I shall be glad
      to wait upon you,&rdquo; replied Goldsmith. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried
      the other eagerly, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not you I mean, Doctor <i>Minor</i>,
      &rsquo;tis Doctor <i>Major</i> there.&rdquo; &ldquo;You may easily
      conceive,&rdquo; said Johnson in relating the anecdote, &ldquo;what effect
      this had upon Goldsmith, who was irascible as a hornet.&rdquo; The only
      comment, however, which he is said to have made, partakes more of quaint
      and dry humor than bitterness: &ldquo;That Graham,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is
      enough to make one commit suicide.&rdquo; What more could be said to
      express the intolerable nuisance of a consummate bore?
    </p>
    <p>
      We have now given the last scenes between Goldsmith and Johnson which
      stand recorded by Boswell. The latter called on the poet a few days after
      the dinner at Dillys&rsquo;, to take leave of him prior to departing for
      Scotland; yet, even in this last interview, he contrives to get up a
      charge of &ldquo;jealousy and envy.&rdquo; Goldsmith, he would fain
      persuade us, is very angry that Johnson is going to travel with him in
      Scotland; and endeavors to persuade him that he will be a dead weight
      &ldquo;to lug along through the Highlands and Hebrides.&rdquo; Any one
      else, knowing the character and habits of Johnson, would have thought the
      same; and no one but Boswell would have supposed his office of bear-leader
      to the ursa major a thing to be envied. [Footnote: One of Peter Pindar&rsquo;s
      (Dr. Wolcot) most amusing <i>jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i> is his congratulatory
      epistle to Boswell on his tour, of which we subjoin a few lines.

      CHAPTER FORTY-TWO
    </h2>
    <p>
      PROJECT OF A DICTIONARY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES&mdash;DISAPPOINTMENT&mdash;NEGLIGENT
      AUTHORSHIP&mdash;APPLICATION FOR A PENSION&mdash;BEATTIE&rsquo;S ESSAY ON
      TRUTH&mdash;PUBLIC ADULATION&mdash;A HIGH-MINDED REBUKE
    </p>
    <p>
      The works which Goldsmith had still in hand being already paid for, and
      the money gone, some new scheme must be devised to provide for the past
      and the future&mdash;for impending debts which threatened to crush him,
      and expenses which were continually increasing. He now projected a work of
      greater compass than any he had yet undertaken; a Dictionary of Arts and
      Sciences on a comprehensive scale, which was to occupy a number of
      volumes. For this he received promises of assistance from several powerful
      hands. Johnson was to contribute an article on ethics; Burke, an abstract
      of his Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, an essay on the Berkleyan
      system of philosophy, and others on political science; Sir Joshua
      Reynolds, an essay on painting; and Garrick, while he undertook on his own
      part to furnish an essay on acting, engaged Dr. Burney to contribute an
      article on music. Here was a great array of talent positively engaged,
      while other writers of eminence were to be sought for the various
      departments of science. Goldsmith was to edit the whole. An undertaking of
      this kind, while it did not incessantly task and exhaust his inventive
      powers by original composition, would give agreeable and profitable
      exercise to his taste and judgment in selecting, compiling, and arranging,
      and he calculated to diffuse over the whole the acknowledged graces of his
      style.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew up a prospectus of the plan, which is said by Bishop Percy, who
      saw it, to have been written with uncommon ability, and to have had that
      perspicuity and elegance for which his writings are remarkable. This
      paper, unfortunately, is no longer in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s expectations, always sanguine respecting any new plan,
      were raised to an extraordinary height by the present project; and well
      they might be, when we consider the powerful coadjutors already pledged.
      They were doomed, however, to complete disappointment. Davies, the
      bibliopole of Russell Street, lets us into the secret of this failure.
      &ldquo;The booksellers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;notwithstanding they had a
      very good opinion of his abilities, yet were startled at the bulk,
      importance, and expense of so great an undertaking, the fate of which was
      to depend upon the industry of a man with whose indolence of temper and
      method of procrastination they had long been acquainted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith certainly gave reason for some such distrust by the heedlessness
      with which he conducted his literary undertakings. Those unfinished, but
      paid for, would be suspended to make way for some job that was to provide
      for present necessities. Those thus hastily taken up would be as hastily
      executed, and the whole, however pressing, would be shoved aside and left
      &ldquo;at loose ends,&rdquo; on some sudden call to social enjoyment or
      recreation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cradock tells us that on one occasion, when Goldsmith was hard at work on
      his Natural History, he sent to Dr. Percy and himself, entreating them to
      finish some pages of his work which lay upon his table, and for which the
      press was urgent, he being detained by other engagements at Windsor. They
      met by appointment at his chambers in the Temple, where they found
      everything in disorder, and costly books lying scattered about on the
      tables and on the floor; many of the books on natural history which he had
      recently consulted lay open among uncorrected proof-sheets. The subject in
      hand, and from which he had suddenly broken off, related to birds. &ldquo;Do
      you know anything about birds?&rdquo; asked Dr. Percy, smiling. &ldquo;Not
      an atom,&rdquo; replied Cradock; &ldquo;do you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not I! I
      scarcely know a goose from a swan: however, let us try what we can do.&rdquo;
      They set to work and completed their friendly task. Goldsmith, however,
      when he came to revise it, made such alterations that they could neither
      of them recognize their own share. The engagement at Windsor, which had
      thus caused Goldsmith to break off suddenly from his multifarious
      engagements, was a party of pleasure with some literary ladies. Another
      anecdote was current, illustrative of the carelessness with which he
      executed works requiring accuracy and research. On the 22d of June he had
      received payment in advance for a Grecian History in two volumes, though
      only one was finished. As he was pushing on doggedly at the second volume,
      Gibbon, the historian, called in. &ldquo;You are the man of all others I
      wish to see,&rdquo; cried the poet, glad to be saved the trouble of
      reference to his books. &ldquo;What was the name of that Indian king who
      gave Alexander the Great so much trouble?&rdquo; &ldquo;Montezuma,&rdquo;
      replied Gibbon, sportively. The heedless author was about committing the
      name to paper without reflection, when Gibbon pretended to recollect
      himself, and gave the true name, Porus.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story, very probably, was a sportive exaggeration; but it was a
      multiplicity of anecdotes like this and the preceding one, some true and
      some false, which had impaired the confidence of booksellers in Goldsmith,
      as a man to be relied on for a task requiring wide and accurate research,
      and close and long-continued application. The project of the Universal
      Dictionary, therefore, met with no encouragement, and fell through.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of this scheme, on which he had built such spacious hopes,
      sank deep into Goldsmith&rsquo;s heart. He was still further grieved and
      mortified by the failure of an effort made by some of his friends to
      obtain for him a pension from government. There had been a talk of the
      disposition of the ministry to extend the bounty of the crown to
      distinguished literary men in pecuniary difficulty, without regard to
      their political creed: when the merits and claims of Goldsmith, however,
      were laid before them, they met no favor. The sin of sturdy independence
      lay at his door. He had refused to become a ministerial hack when offered
      a <i>carte blanche</i> by Parson, Scott, the cabinet emissary. The
      wondering parson had left him his poverty and &ldquo;<i>his garrets</i>&rdquo;
      and there the ministry were disposed to suffer him to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Dr. Beattie comes out with his Essay On Truth, and all the
      orthodox world are thrown into a paroxysm of contagious ecstasy. He is
      cried up as the great champion of Christianity against the attacks of
      modern philosophers and infidels; he is feted and flattered in every way.
      He receives at Oxford the honorary degree of doctor of civil law, at the
      same time with Sir Joshua Reynolds. The king sends for him, praises his
      Essay, and gives him a pension of two hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith feels more acutely the denial of a pension to himself when one
      has thus been given unsolicited to a man he might without vanity consider
      so much his inferior. He was not one to conceal his feelings. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
      such a stir,&rdquo; said he one day at Thrale&rsquo;s table, &ldquo;about
      a fellow that has written one book, and I have written so many!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, doctor!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnson, in one of his caustic moods,
      &ldquo;there go two and forty sixpences, you know, to one guinea.&rdquo;
      This is one of the cuts at poor Goldsmith in which Johnson went contrary
      to head and heart in his love for saying what is called a &ldquo;good
      thing.&rdquo; No one knew better than himself the comparative superiority
      of the writings of Goldsmith; but the jingle of the sixpences and the
      guinea was not to be resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Thrale, &ldquo;loves Dr. Beattie,
      but Goldsmith, who says he cannot bear the sight of so much applause as
      they all bestow upon him. Did he not tell us so himself no one would
      believe he was so exceedingly ill-natured.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He told them so himself because he was too open and unreserved to disguise
      his feelings, and because he really considered the praise lavished on
      Beattie extravagant, as in fact it was. It was all, of course, set down to
      sheer envy and uncharitableness. To add to his annoyance, he found his
      friend, Sir Joshua Reynolds, joining in the universal adulation. He had
      painted a full-length portrait of Beattie decked in the doctor&rsquo;s
      robes in which he had figured at Oxford, with the Essay on Truth under his
      arm and the angel of truth at his side, while Voltaire figured as one of
      the demons of infidelity, sophistry, and falsehood, driven into utter
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldsmith had known Voltaire in early life; he had been his admirer and
      his biographer; he grieved to find him receiving such an insult from the
      classic pencil of his friend. &ldquo;It is unworthy of you,&rdquo; said he
      to Sir Joshua, &ldquo;to debase so high a genius as Voltaire before so
      mean a writer as Beattie. Beattie and his book will be forgotten in ten
      years, while Voltaire&rsquo;s fame will last forever. Take care it does
      not perpetuate this picture to the shame of such a man as you.&rdquo; This
      noble and high-minded rebuke is the only instance on record of any
      reproachful words between the poet and the painter; and we are happy to
      find that it did not destroy the harmony of their intercourse.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FORTY-THREE
    </h2>
    <p>
      TOIL WITHOUT HOPE&mdash;THE POET IN THE GREEN-ROOM&mdash;IN THE FLOWER
      GARDEN&mdash;AT VAUXHALL&mdash;DISSIPATION WITHOUT GAYETY&mdash;CRADOCK IN
      TOWN&mdash;FRIENDLY SYMPATHY&mdash;A PARTING SCENE&mdash;AN INVITATION TO
      PLEASURE
    </p>
    <p>
      Thwarted in the plans and disappointed in the hopes which had recently
      cheered and animated him, Goldsmith found the labor at his half-finished
      tasks doubly irksome from the consciousness that the completion of them
      could not relieve him from his pecuniary embarrassments. His impaired
      health, also, rendered him less capable than formerly of sedentary
      application, and continual perplexities disturbed the flow of thought
      necessary for original composition. He lost his usual gayety and
      good-humor, and became, at times, peevish and irritable. Too proud of
      spirit to seek sympathy or relief from his friends, for the pecuniary
      difficulties he had brought upon himself by his errors and extravagance;
      and unwilling, perhaps, to make known their amount, he buried his cares
      and anxieties in his own bosom, and endeavored in company to keep up his
      usual air of gayety and unconcern. This gave his conduct an appearance of
      fitfulness and caprice, varying suddenly from moodiness to mirth, and from
      silent gravity to shallow laughter; causing surprise and ridicule in those
      who were not aware of the sickness of heart which lay beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      His poetical reputation, too, was sometimes a disadvantage to him; it drew
      upon him a notoriety which he was not always in the mood or the vein to
      act up to. &ldquo;Good heavens, Mr. Foote,&rdquo; exclaimed an actress at
      the Haymarket Theater, &ldquo;what a humdrum kind of man Dr. Goldsmith
      appears in our green-room compared with the figure he makes in his poetry!&rdquo;
      &ldquo;The reason of that, madam,&rdquo; replied Foote, &ldquo;is because
      the muses are better company than the players.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauclerc&rsquo;s letters to his friend, Lord Charlemont, who was absent
      in Ireland, give us now and then an indication of the whereabout of the
      poet during the present year. &ldquo;I have been but once to the club
      since you left England,&rdquo; writes he; &ldquo;we were entertained, as
      usual, with Goldsmith&rsquo;s absurdity.&rdquo; With Beauclerc everything
      was absurd that was not polished and pointed. In another letter he
      threatens, unless Lord Charlemont returns to England, to bring over the
      whole club, and let them loose upon him to drive him home by their
      peculiar habits of annoyance&mdash;Johnson shall spoil his books;
      Goldsmith shall <i>pull his flowers;</i> and last, and most intolerable of
      all, Boswell shall&mdash;talk to him. It would appear that the poet, who
      had a passion for flowers, was apt to pass much of his time in the garden
      when on a visit to a country seat, much to the detriment of the flowerbeds
      and the despair of the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer wore heavily away with Goldsmith. He had not his usual solace
      of a country retreat; his health was impaired and his spirits depressed.
      Sir Joshua Reynolds, who perceived the state of his mind, kindly gave him
      much of his company. In the course of their interchange of thought,
      Goldsmith suggested to him the story of Ugolino, as a subject for his
      pencil. The painting founded on it remains a memento of their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 4th of August we find them together at Vauxhall; at that time a
      place in high vogue, and which had once been to Goldsmith a scene of
      Oriental splendor and delight. We have, in fact, in the Citizen of the
      World, a picture of it as it had struck him in former years and in his
      happier moods. &ldquo;Upon entering the gardens,&rdquo; says the Chinese
      philosopher, &ldquo;I found every sense occupied with more than expected
      pleasure; the lights everywhere glimmering through the scarcely-moving
      trees; the full-bodied concert bursting on the stillness of the night; the
      natural concert of the birds in the more retired part of the grove, vying
      with that which was formed by art; the company gayly dressed, looking
      satisfaction, and the tables spread with various delicacies, all conspired
      to fill my imagination with the visionary happiness of the Arabian
      lawgiver, and lifted me into an ecstasy of admiration.&rdquo; [Footnote:
      Citizen of the World, Letter xxi]
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything now, however, is seen with different eyes; with him it is
      dissipation without pleasure; and he finds it impossible any longer, by
      mingling in the gay and giddy throng of apparently prosperous and happy
      beings, to escape from the carking care which is clinging to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      His kind friend, Cradock, came up to town toward autumn, when all the
      fashionable world was in the country, to give his wife the benefit of a
      skillful dentist. He took lodgings in Norfolk Street, to be in Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      neighborhood, and passed most of his mornings with him. &ldquo;I found
      him,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;much altered and at times very low. He wished
      me to look over and revise some of his works; but, with a select friend or
      two, I was more pressing that he should publish by subscription his two
      celebrated poems of the Traveler and the Deserted Village, with notes.&rdquo;
      The idea of Cradock was that the subscription would enable wealthy
      persons, favorable to Goldsmith, to contribute to his pecuniary relief
      without wounding his pride. &ldquo;Goldsmith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;readily
      gave up to me his private copies, and said, &lsquo;Pray do what you please
      with them.&rsquo; But while he sat near me, he rather submitted to than
      encouraged my zealous proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I one morning called upon him, however, and found him infinitely
      better than I had expected; and, in a kind of exulting style, he
      exclaimed, &lsquo;Here are some of the best of my prose writings; <i>I
      have been hard at work since midnight,</i> and I desire you to examine
      them.&rsquo; &lsquo;These,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;are excellent indeed.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;They are,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;intended as an introduction to
      a body of arts and sciences.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Goldsmith was, in fact, gathering together the fragments of his
      shipwreck; the notes and essays and memoranda collected for his
      dictionary, and proposed to found on them a work in two volumes, to be
      entitled A Survey of Experimental Philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of the subscription came to nothing, and the projected survey
      never was executed. The head might yet devise, but the heart was failing
      him; his talent at hoping, which gave him buoyancy to carry out his
      enterprises, was almost at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cradock&rsquo;s farewell scene with him is told in a simple but touching
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day before I was to set out for Leicestershire I insisted upon
      his dining with us. He replied, &lsquo;I will, but on one condition, that
      you will not ask me to eat anything.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said I,
      &lsquo;this answer is absolutely unkind, for I had hoped, as we are
      supplied from the Crown and Anchor, that you would have named something
      you might have relished.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;if
      you will but explain it to Mrs. Cradock, I will certainly wait upon you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor found, as usual, at my apartments, newspapers and
      pamphlets, and with a pen and ink he amused himself as well as he could. I
      had ordered from the tavern some fish, a roasted joint of lamb, and a
      tart; and the doctor either sat down or walked about just as he pleased.
      After dinner he took some wine with biscuits; but I was obliged soon to
      leave him for a while, as I had matters to settle prior to my next day&rsquo;s
      journey. On my return coffee was ready, and the doctor appeared more
      cheerful (for Mrs. Cradock was always rather a favorite with him), and in
      the evening he endeavored to talk and remark as usual, but all was forced.
      He stayed till midnight, and I insisted on seeing him safe home, and we
      most cordially shook hands at the Temple gate.&rdquo; Cradock little
      thought that this was to be their final parting. He looked back to it with
      mournful recollections in after years, and lamented that he had not
      remained longer in town at every inconvenience, to solace the poor
      broken-spirited poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter continued in town all the autumn. At the opening of the Opera
      House, on the 20th of November, Mrs. Yates, an actress whom he held in
      great esteem, delivered a poetical exordium of his composition. Beauclerc,
      in a letter to Lord Charlemont, pronounced it very good, and predicted
      that it would soon be in all the papers. It does not appear, however, to
      have been ever published. In his fitful state of mind Goldsmith may have
      taken no care about it, and thus it has been lost to the world, although
      it was received with great applause by a crowded and brilliant audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of sunshine breaks through the gloom that was gathering over the
      poet. Toward the end of the year he receives another Christmas invitation
      to Barton. A country Christmas! with all the cordiality of the fireside
      circle, and the joyous revelry of the oaken hall&mdash;what a contrast to
      the loneliness of a bachelor&rsquo;s chambers in the Temple! It is not to
      be resisted. But how is poor Goldsmith to raise the ways and means? His
      purse is empty; his booksellers are already in advance to him. As a last
      resource, he applies to Garrick. Their mutual intimacy at Barton may have
      suggested him as an alternative. The old loan of forty pounds has never
      been paid; and Newbery&rsquo;s note, pledged as a security, has never been
      taken up. An additional loan of sixty pounds is now asked for, thus
      increasing the loan to one hundred; to insure the payment, he now offers,
      besides Newbery&rsquo;s note, the transfer of the comedy of the
      Good-Natured Man to Drury Lane, with such alterations as Garrick may
      suggest. Garrick, in reply, evades the offer of the altered comedy,
      alludes significantly to a new one which Goldsmith had talked of writing
      for him, and offers to furnish the money required on his own acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply of Goldsmith bespeaks a heart brimful of gratitude and
      overflowing with fond anticipations of Barton and the smiles of its fair
      residents. &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; writes he, &ldquo;I thank you. I
      wish I could do something to serve you. I shall have a comedy for you in a
      season, or two at furthest, that I believe will be worth your acceptance,
      for I fancy I will make it a fine thing. You shall have the refusal.... I
      will draw upon you one month after date for sixty pounds, and your
      acceptance will be ready money, <i>part of which I want to go down to
      Barton with</i>. May God preserve my honest little man, for he has my
      heart. Ever,
    </p>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;OLIVER GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      And having thus scrambled together a little pocket-money, by hard
      contrivance, poor Goldsmith turns his back upon care and trouble, and
      Temple quarters, to forget for a time his desolate bachelorhood in the
      family circle and a Christmas fireside at Barton.

      CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR
    </h2>
    <p>
      A RETURN TO DRUDGERY&mdash;FORCED GAYETY&mdash;RETREAT TO THE COUNTRY&mdash;THE
      POEM OF RETALIATION&mdash;PORTRAIT OF GARRICK&mdash;OF GOLDSMITH&mdash;OF
      REYNOLDS&mdash;ILLNESS OF THE POET&mdash;HIS DEATH&mdash;GRIEF OF HIS
      FRIENDS&mdash;A LAST WORD RESPECTING THE JESSAMY BRIDE
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barton festivities are over; Christmas, with all its home-felt revelry
      of the heart, has passed like a dream; the Jessamy Bride has beamed her
      last smile upon the poor poet, and the early part of 1774 finds him in his
      now dreary bachelor abode in the Temple, toiling fitfully and hopelessly
      at a multiplicity of tasks. His Animated Nature, so long delayed, so often
      interrupted, is at length announced for publication, though it has yet to
      receive a few finishing touches. He is preparing a third History of
      England, to be compressed and condensed in one volume, for the use of
      schools. He is revising his Inquiry into Polite Learning, for which he
      receives the pittance of five guineas, much needed in his present
      scantiness of purse; he is arranging his Survey of Experimental
      Philosophy, and he is translating the Comic Romance of Scarron. Such is a
      part of the various labors of a drudging, depressing kind, by which his
      head is made wrong and his heart faint. &ldquo;If there is a mental
      drudgery,&rdquo; says Sir Walter Scott, &ldquo;which lowers the spirits
      and lacerates the nerves, like the toil of a slave, it is that which is
      exacted by literary composition, when the heart is not in unison with the
      work upon which the head is employed. Add to the unhappy author&rsquo;s
      task sickness, sorrow, or the pressure of unfavorable circumstances, and
      the labor of the bondsman becomes light in comparison.&rdquo; Goldsmith
      again makes an effort to rally his spirits by going into gay society.
      &ldquo;Our club,&rdquo; writes Beauclerc to Charlemont, on the 12th of
      February, &ldquo;has dwindled away to nothing. Sir Joshua and Goldsmith
      have got into such a round of pleasures that they have no time.&rdquo;
      This shows how little Beauclerc was the companion of the poet&rsquo;s
      mind, or could judge of him below the surface. Reynolds, the kind
      participator in joyless dissipation, could have told a different story of
      his companion&rsquo;s heart-sick gayety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this forced mood Goldsmith gave entertainments in his chambers in the
      Temple; the last of which was a dinner to Johnson, Reynolds, and others of
      his intimates, who partook with sorrow and reluctance of his imprudent
      hospitality. The first course vexed them by its needless profusion. When a
      second, equally extravagant, was served up, Johnson and Reynolds declined
      to partake of it; the rest of the company, understanding their motives,
      followed their example, and the dishes went from the table untasted.
      Goldsmith felt sensibly this silent and well-intended rebuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gayeties of society, however, cannot medicine for any length of time a
      mind diseased. Wearied by the distractions and harassed by the expenses of
      a town life, which he had not the discretion to regulate, Goldsmith took
      the resolution, too tardily adopted, of retiring to the serene quiet and
      cheap and healthful pleasures of the country, and of passing only two
      months of the year in London. He accordingly made arrangements to sell his
      right in the Temple chambers, and in the month of March retired to his
      country quarters at Hyde, there to devote himself to toil. At this
      dispirited juncture, when inspiration seemed to be at an end, and the
      poetic fire extinguished, a spark fell on his combustible imagination and
      set it in a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      He belonged to a temporary association of men of talent, some of them
      members of the Literary Club, who dined together occasionally at the St.
      James&rsquo; Coffee-house. At these dinners, as usual, he was one of the
      last to arrive. On one occasion, when he was more dilatory than usual, a
      whim seized the company to write epitaphs on him, as &ldquo;The late Dr.
      Goldsmith,&rdquo; and several were thrown off in a playful vein, hitting
      off his peculiarities. The only one extant was written by Garrick, and has
      been preserved, very probably, by its pungency:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here lies poet Goldsmith, for shortness called Noll,
  Who wrote like an angel, but talked like poor poll.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Goldsmith did not relish the sarcasm, especially as coming from such a
      quarter. He was not very ready at repartee; but he took his time, and in
      the interval of his various tasks concocted a series of epigrammatic
      sketches, under the title of Retaliation, in which the characters of his
      distinguished intimates were admirably hit off, with a mixture of generous
      praise and good-humored raillery. In fact, the poem for its graphic truth;
      its nice discrimination; its terse good sense, and its shrewd knowledge of
      the world, must have electrified the club almost as much as the first
      appearance of The Traveler, and let them still deeper into the character
      and talents of the man they had been accustomed to consider as their butt.
      Retaliation, in a word, closed his accounts with the club, and balanced
      all his previous deficiencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait of David Garrick is one of the most elaborate in the poem.
      When the poet came to touch it off, he had some lurking piques to gratify,
      which the recent attack had revived. He may have forgotten David&rsquo;s
      cavalier treatment of him, in the early days of his comparative obscurity;
      he may have forgiven his refusal of his plays; but Garrick had been
      capricious in his conduct in the times of their recent intercourse;
      sometimes treating him with gross familiarity, at other times affecting
      dignity and reserve, and assuming airs of superiority; frequently he had
      been facetious and witty in company at his expense, and lastly he had been
      guilty of the couplet just quoted. Goldsmith, therefore, touched off the
      lights and shadows of his character with a free hand, and, at the same
      time, gave a side hit at his old rival, Kelly, and his critical
      persecutor, Kenrick, in making them sycophantic satellites of the actor.
      Goldsmith, however, was void of gall, even in his revenge, and his very
      satire was more humorous than caustic:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here lies David Garrick, describe him who can,
  An abridgment of all that was pleasant in man;
  As an actor, confess&rsquo;d without rival to shine;
  As a wit, if not first, in the very first line:
  Yet, with talents like these, and an excellent heart.
  The man had his failings, a dupe to his art.
  Like an ill-judging beauty, his colors he spread,
  And beplaster&rsquo;d with rouge his own natural red.
  On the stage he was natural, simple, affecting;
  &lsquo;Twas only that when he was off he was acting.
  With no reason on earth to go out of his way,
  He turn&rsquo;d and he varied full ten times a day:
  Though secure of our hearts, yet confoundedly sick
  If they were not his own by finessing and trick:
  He cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack,
  For he knew, when he pleased, he could whistle them back.
  Of praise a mere glutton, he swallow&rsquo;d what came,
  And the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame;
  Till his relish, grown callous almost to disease,
  Who pepper&rsquo;d the highest was surest to please.
  But let us be candid, and speak out our mind,
  If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind.
  Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys, and Woodfalls so grave,
  What a commerce was yours, while you got and you gavel
  How did Grub Street re-echo the shouts that you raised,
  While he was be-Rosciused and you were be-praised!
  But peace to his spirit, wherever it flies,
  To act as an angel and mix with the skies;
  Those poets who owe their best fame to his skill,
  Shall still be his flatterers, go where he will;
  Old Shakespeare receive him with praise and with love,
  And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This portion of Retaliation soon brought a retort from Garrick, which we
      insert, as giving something of a likeness of Goldsmith, though in broad
      caricature:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here, Hermes, says Jove, who with nectar was mellow,
  Go fetch me some clay&mdash;I will make an odd fellow:
  Right and wrong shall be jumbled, much gold and some dross,
  Without cause be he pleased, without cause be he cross;
  Be sure, as I work, to throw in contradictions,
  A great love of truth, yet a mind turn&rsquo;d to fictions;
  Now mix these ingredients, which, warm&rsquo;d in the baking,
  Turn&rsquo;d to <i>learning</i> and <i>gaming</i>, <i>religion</i>, and
                <i>raking</i>,
  With the love of a wench, let his writings be chaste;
  Tip his tongue with strange matters, his lips with fine taste;
  That the rake and the poet o&rsquo;er all may prevail,
  Set fire to the head and set fire to the tail;
  For the joy of each sex on the world I&rsquo;ll bestow it,
  This scholar, rake, Christian, dupe, gamester, and poet.
  Though a mixture so odd, he shall merit great fame,
  And among brother mortals be Goldsmith his name;
  When on earth this strange meteor no more shall appear,
  You, <i>Hermes</i>, shall fetch him, to make us sport here.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The charge of raking, so repeatedly advanced in the foregoing lines, must
      be considered a sportive one, founded, perhaps, on an incident or two
      within Garrick&rsquo;s knowledge, but not borne out by the course of
      Goldsmith&rsquo;s life. He seems to have had a tender sentiment for the
      sex, but perfectly free from libertinism. Neither was he an habitual
      gamester. The strictest scrutiny has detected no settled vice of the kind.
      He was fond of a game of cards, but an unskillful and careless player.
      Cards in those days were universally introduced into society. High play
      was, in fact, a fashionable amusement, as at one time was deep drinking;
      and a man might occasionally lose large sums, and be beguiled into deep
      potations, without incurring the character of a gamester or a drunkard.
      Poor Goldsmith, on his advent into high society, assumed fine notions with
      fine clothes; he was thrown occasionally among high players, men of
      fortune who could sport their cool hundreds as carelessly as his early
      comrades at Ballymahon could their half crowns. Being at all times
      magnificent in money matters, he may have played with them in their own
      way, without considering that what was sport to them to him was ruin.
      Indeed part of his financial embarrassments may have arisen from losses of
      the kind, incurred inadvertently, not in the indulgence of a habit.
      &ldquo;I do not believe Goldsmith to have deserved the name of gamester,&rdquo;
      said one of his contemporaries; &ldquo;he liked cards very well, as other
      people do, and lost and won occasionally; but as far as I saw or heard,
      and I had many opportunities of hearing, never any considerable sum. If he
      gamed with any one, it was probably with Beauclerc, but I do not know that
      such was the case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Retaliation, as we have already observed, was thrown off in parts, at
      intervals, and was never completed. Some characters, originally intended
      to be introduced, remained unattempted; others were but partially sketched&mdash;such
      was the one of Reynolds, the friend of his heart, and which he commenced
      with a felicity which makes us regret that it should remain unfinished.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here Reynolds is laid, and to tell you my mind,
  He has not left a wiser or better behind.
  His pencil was striking, resistless, and grand;
  His manners were gentle, complying, and bland;
  Still born to improve us in every part,
  His pencil our faces, his manners our heart.
  To coxcombs averse, yet most civilly steering,
  When they judged without skill he was still hard of hearing:
  When they talked of their Raphaels, Correggios, and stuff,
  He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff.
  By flattery unspoiled&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The friendly portrait stood unfinished on the easel; the hand of the
      artist had failed! An access of a local complaint, under which he had
      suffered for some time past, added to a general prostration of health,
      brought Goldsmith back to town before he had well settled himself in the
      country. The local complaint subsided, but was followed by a low nervous
      fever. He was not aware of his critical situation, and intended to be at
      the club on the 25th of March, on which occasion Charles Fox, Sir Charles
      Bunbury (one of the Horneck connection), and two other new members were to
      be present. In the afternoon, however, he felt so unwell as to take to his
      bed, and his symptoms soon acquired sufficient force to keep him there.
      His malady fluctuated for several days, and hopes were entertained of his
      recovery, but they proved fallacious. He had skillful medical aid and
      faithful nursing, but he would not follow the advice of his physicians,
      and persisted in the use of James&rsquo; powders, which he had once found
      beneficial, but which were now injurious to him. His appetite was gone,
      his strength failed him, but his mind remained clear, and was perhaps too
      active for his frame. Anxieties and disappointments which had previously
      sapped his constitution, doubtless aggravated his present complaint and
      rendered him sleepless. In reply to an inquiry of his physician, he
      acknowledged that his mind was ill at ease. This was his last reply; he
      was too weak to talk, and in general took no notice of what was said to
      him. He sank at last into a deep sleep, and it was hoped a favorable
      crisis had arrived. He awoke, however, in strong convulsions, which
      continued without intermission until he expired, on the fourth of April,
      at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning; being in the forty-sixth year of his
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      His death was a shock to the literary world, and a deep affliction to a
      wide circle of intimates and friends; for with all his foibles and
      peculiarities, he was fully as much beloved as he was admired. Burke, on
      hearing the news, burst into tears. Sir Joshua Reynolds threw by his
      pencil for the day, and grieved more than he had done in times of great
      family distress. &ldquo;I was abroad at the time of his death,&rdquo;
      writes Dr. M&rsquo;Donnell, the youth whom when in distress he had
      employed as an amanuensis, &ldquo;and I wept bitterly when the
      intelligence first reached me. A blank came over my heart as if I had lost
      one of my nearest relatives, and was followed for some days by a feeling
      of despondency.&rdquo; Johnson felt the blow deeply and gloomily. In
      writing some time afterward to Boswell, he observed, &ldquo;Of poor Dr.
      Goldsmith there is little to be told more than the papers have made
      public. He died of a fever, made, I am afraid, more violent by uneasiness
      of mind. His debts began to be heavy, and all his resources were
      exhausted. Sir Joshua is of opinion that he owed no less than two thousand
      pounds. Was ever poet so trusted before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Among his debts were seventy-nine pounds due to his tailor, Mr. William
      Filby, from whom he had received a new suit but a few days before his
      death. &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said the younger Filby, &ldquo;though a
      loser to that amount, attributed no blame to Goldsmith; he had been a good
      customer, and had he lived would have paid every farthing.&rdquo; Others
      of his tradespeople evinced the same confidence in his integrity,
      notwithstanding his heedlessness. Two sister milliners in Temple Lane, who
      had been accustomed to deal with him, were concerned, when told, some time
      before his death, of his pecuniary embarrassments. &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo;
      said they to Mr. Cradock, &ldquo;sooner persuade him to let us work for
      him gratis than apply to any other; we are sure he will pay us when he
      can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the stairs of his apartment there was the lamentation of the old and
      infirm, and the sobbing of women; poor objects of his charity to whom he
      had never turned a deaf ear, even when struggling himself with poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one mourner, whose enthusiasm for his memory, could it have
      been foreseen, might have soothed the bitterness of death. After the
      coffin had been screwed down, a lock of his hair was requested for a lady,
      a particular friend, who wished to preserve it as a remembrance. It was
      the beautiful Mary Horneck&mdash;the Jessamy Bride. The coffin was opened
      again, and a lock of hair cut off; which she treasured to her dying day.
      Poor Goldsmith! could he have foreseen that such a memorial of him was to
      be thus cherished!
    </p>
    <p>
      One word more concerning this lady, to whom we have so often ventured to
      advert. She survived almost to the present day. Hazlitt met her at
      Northcote&rsquo;s painting-room, about twenty years since, as Mrs. Gwyn,
      the widow of a General Gwyn of the army. She was at that time upward of
      seventy years of age. Still, he said, she was beautiful, beautiful even in
      years. After she was gone, Hazlitt remarked how handsome she still was.
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Northcote, &ldquo;why she is so kind as
      to come to see me, except that I am the last link in the chain that
      connects her with all those she most esteemed when young&mdash;Johnson,
      Reynolds, Goldsmith&mdash;and remind her of the most delightful period of
      her life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Not only so,&rdquo; observed Hazlitt, &ldquo;but
      you remember what she was at twenty; and you thus bring back to her the
      triumphs of her youth&mdash;that pride of beauty, which must be the more
      fondly cherished as it has no external vouchers, and lives chiefly in the
      bosom of its once lovely possessor. In her, however, the Graces had
      triumphed over time; she was one of Ninon de l&rsquo;Enclos&rsquo; people,
      of the last of the immortals. I could almost fancy the shade of Goldsmith
      in the room, looking round with complacency.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jessamy Bride survived her sister upward of forty years, and died in
      1840, within a few days of completing her eighty-eighth year. &ldquo;She
      had gone through all the stages of life,&rdquo; says Northcote, &ldquo;and
      had lent a grace to each.&rdquo; However gayly she may have sported with
      the half-concealed admiration of the poor awkward poet in the heyday of
      her youth and beauty, and however much it may have been made a subject of
      teasing by her youthful companions, she evidently prided herself in after
      years upon having been an object of his affectionate regard; it certainly
      rendered her interesting throughout life in the eyes of his admirers, and
      has hung a poetical wreath above her grave.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FUNERAL&mdash;THE MONUMENT&mdash;THE EPITAPH&mdash;CONCLUDING REMARKS
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the warm feeling of the moment, while the remains of the poet were
      scarce cold, it was determined by his friends to honor them by a public
      funeral and a tomb in Westminster Abbey. His very pall-bearers were
      designated: Lord Shelburne, Lord Lowth, Sir Joshua Reynolds; the Hon. Mr.
      Beauclerc, Mr. Burke, and David Garrick. This feeling cooled down,
      however, when it was discovered that he died in debt, and had not left
      wherewithal to pay for such expensive obsequies. Five days after his
      death, therefore, at five o&rsquo;clock of Saturday evening, the 9th of
      April, he was privately interred in the burying-ground of the Temple
      Church; a few persons attending as mourners, among whom we do not find
      specified any of his peculiar and distinguished friends. The chief mourner
      was Sir Joshua Reynolds&rsquo; nephew, Palmer, afterward Dean of Cashel.
      One person, however, from whom it was but little to be expected, attended
      the funeral and evinced real sorrow on the occasion. This was Hugh Kelly,
      once the dramatic rival of the deceased, and often, it is said, his
      anonymous assailant in the newspapers. If he had really been guilty of
      this basest of literary offenses, he was punished by the stings of
      remorse, for we are told that he shed bitter tears over the grave of the
      man he had injured. His tardy atonement only provoked the lash of some
      unknown satirist, as the following lines will show:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Hence Kelly, who years, without honor or shame,
  Had been sticking his bodkin in Oliver&rsquo;s fame,
  Who thought, like the Tartar, by this to inherit
  His genius, his learning, simplicity, spirit;
  Now sets every feature to weep o&rsquo;er his fate,
  And acts as a mourner to blubber in state.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      One base wretch deserves to be mentioned, the reptile Kenrick, who, after
      having repeatedly slandered Goldsmith while living, had the audacity to
      insult his memory when dead. The following distich is sufficient to show
      his malignancy, and to hold him up to execration:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;By his own art, who justly died,
  A blund&rsquo;ring, artless suicide:
  Share, earthworms, share, since now he&rsquo;s dead,
  His megrim, maggot-bitten head.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      This scurrilous epitaph produced a burst of public indignation that awed
      for a time even the infamous Kenrick into silence. On the other hand, the
      press teemed with tributes in verse and prose to the memory of the
      deceased; all evincing the mingled feeling of admiration for the author
      and affection for the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after his death the Literary Club set on foot a subscription, and
      raised a fund to erect a monument to his memory in Westminster Abbey. It
      was executed by Nollekins, and consisted simply of a bust of the poet in
      profile, in high relief, in a medallion, and was placed in the area of a
      pointed arch, over the south door in Poets&rsquo; Corner, between the
      monuments of Gay and the Duke of Argyle. Johnson furnished a Latin
      epitaph, which was read at the table of Sir Joshua Reynolds, where several
      members of the club and other friends of the deceased were present. Though
      considered by them a masterly composition, they thought the literary
      character of the poet not defined with sufficient exactness, and they
      preferred that the epitaph should be in English rather than Latin, as
      &ldquo;the memory of so eminent an English writer ought to be perpetuated
      in the language to which his works were likely to be so lasting an
      ornament.&rdquo; These objections were reduced to writing, to be
      respectfully submitted to Johnson, but such was the awe entertained of his
      frown that every one shrank from putting his name first to the instrument;
      whereupon their names were written about it in a circle, making what
      mutinous sailors call a Round Robin. Johnson received it half graciously,
      half grimly. &ldquo;He was willing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to modify the
      sense of the epitaph in any manner the gentlemen pleased; <i>but he never
      would consent to disgrace the walls of Westminster Abbey with an English
      inscription</i>.&rdquo; Seeing the names of Dr. Wharton and Edmund Burke
      among the signers, &ldquo;he wondered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Joe
      Wharton, a scholar by profession, should be such a fool; and should have
      thought that Mund Burke would have had more sense.&rdquo; The following is
      the epitaph as it stands inscribed on a white marble tablet beneath the
      bust:

      We shall not pretend to follow these anecdotes of the life of Goldsmith
      with any critical dissertation on his writings; their merits have long
      since been fully discussed, and their station in the scale of literary
      merit permanently established. They have outlasted generations of works of
      higher power and wider scope, and will continue to outlast succeeding
      generations, for they have that magic charm of style by which works are
      embalmed to perpetuity. Neither shall we attempt a regular analysis of the
      character of the poet, but will indulge in a few desultory remarks in
      addition to those scattered throughout the preceding chapters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was the trite, because sage apothegm, that &ldquo;The child is
      father to the man,&rdquo; more fully verified than in the case of
      Goldsmith. He is shy, awkward, and blundering in childhood, yet full of
      sensibility; he is a butt for the jeers and jokes of his companions, but
      apt to surprise and confound them by sudden and witty repartees; he is
      dull and stupid at his tasks, yet an eager and intelligent devourer of the
      traveling tales and campaigning stories of his half military pedagogue; he
      may be a dunce, but he is already a rhymer; and his early scintillations
      of poetry awaken the expectations of his friends. He seems from infancy to
      have been compounded of two natures, one bright, the other blundering; or
      to have had fairy gifts laid in his cradle by the &ldquo;good people&rdquo;
      who haunted his birthplace, the old goblin mansion on the banks of the
      Inny.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carries with him the wayward elfin spirit, if we may so term it,
      throughout his career. His fairy gifts are of no avail at school, academy,
      or college; they unfit him for close study and practical science, and
      render him heedless of everything that does not address itself to his
      poetical imagination and genial and festive feelings; they dispose him to
      break away from restraint, to stroll about hedges, green lanes, and
      haunted streams, to revel with jovial companions, or to rove the country
      like a gypsy in quest of odd adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if confiding in these delusive gifts, he takes no heed of the present
      nor care for the future, lays no regular and solid foundation of
      knowledge, follows out no plan, adopts and discards those recommended by
      his friends, at one time prepares for the ministry, next turns to the law,
      and then fixes upon medicine. He repairs to Edinburgh, the great emporium
      of medical science, but the fairy gifts accompany him; he idles and
      frolics away his time there, imbibing only such knowledge as is agreeable
      to him; makes an excursion to the poetical regions of the Highlands; and
      having walked the hospitals for the customary time, sets off to ramble
      over the Continent, in quest of novelty rather than knowledge. His whole
      tour is a poetical one. He fancies he is playing the philosopher while he
      is really playing the poet; and though professedly he attends lectures and
      visits foreign universities, so deficient is he on his return, in the
      studies for which he set out, that he fails in an examination as a surgeon&rsquo;s
      mate; and while figuring as a doctor of medicine, is outvied on a point of
      practice by his apothecary. Baffled in every regular pursuit, after trying
      in vain some of the humbler callings of commonplace life, he is driven
      almost by chance to the exercise of his pen, and here the fairy gifts come
      to his assistance. For a long time, however, he seems unaware of the magic
      properties of that pen; he uses it only as a makeshift until he can find a
      <i>legitimate</i> means of support. He is not a learned man, and can write
      but meagerly and at second-hand on learned subjects; but he has a quick
      convertible talent that seizes lightly on the points of knowledge
      necessary to the illustration of a theme; his writings for a time are
      desultory, the fruits of what he has seen and felt, or what he has
      recently and hastily read; but his gifted pen transmutes everything into
      gold, and his own genial nature reflects its sunshine through his pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still unaware of his powers he throws off his writings anonymously, to go
      with the writings of less favored men; and it is a long time, and after a
      bitter struggle with poverty and humiliation, before he acquires
      confidence in his literary talent as a means of support, and begins to
      dream of reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time his pen is a wand of power in his hand, and he has only to
      use it discreetly, to make it competent to all his wants. But discretion
      is not a part of Goldsmith&rsquo;s nature; and it seems the property of
      these fairy gifts to be accompanied by moods and temperaments to render
      their effect precarious. The heedlessness of his early days; his
      disposition for social enjoyment; his habit of throwing the present on the
      neck of the future, still continue. His expenses forerun his means; he
      incurs debts on the faith of what his magic pen is to produce, and then,
      under the pressure of his debts, sacrifices its productions for prices far
      below their value. It is a redeeming circumstance in his prodigality, that
      it is lavished oftener upon others than upon himself; he gives without
      thought or stint, and is the continual dupe of his benevolence and his
      trustfulness in human nature. We may say of him as he says of one of his
      heroes, &ldquo;He could not stifle the natural impulse which he had to do
      good, but frequently borrowed money to relieve the distressed; and when he
      knew not conveniently where to borrow, he has been observed to shed tears
      as he passed through the wretched suppliants who attended his gate.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His simplicity in trusting persons whom he had no previous reasons
      to place confidence in, seems to be one of those lights of his character
      which, while they impeach his understanding, do honor to his benevolence.
      The low and the timid are ever suspicious; but a heart impressed with
      honorable sentiments expects from others sympathetic sincerity.&rdquo;
      [Footnote: Goldsmith&rsquo;s Life of Nashe.]
    </p>
    <p>
      His heedlessness in pecuniary matters, which had rendered his life a
      struggle with poverty even in the days of his obscurity, rendered the
      struggle still more intense when his fairy gifts had elevated him into the
      society of the wealthy and luxurious, and imposed on his simple and
      generous spirit fancied obligations to a more ample and bounteous display.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How comes it,&rdquo; says a recent and ingenious critic, &ldquo;that
      in all the miry paths of life which he had trod, no speck ever sullied the
      robe of his modest and graceful muse. How amid all that love of inferior
      company, which never to the last forsook him, did he keep his genius so
      free from every touch of vulgarity?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We answer that it was owing to the innate purity and goodness of his
      nature; there was nothing in it that assimilated to vice and vulgarity.
      Though his circumstances often compelled him to associate with the poor,
      they never could betray him into companionship with the depraved. His
      relish for humor and for the study of character, as we have before
      observed, brought him often into convivial company of a vulgar kind; but
      he discriminated between their vulgarity and their amusing qualities, or
      rather wrought from the whole those familiar features of life which form
      the staple of his most popular writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much, too, of this intact purity of heart may be ascribed to the lessons
      of his infancy under the paternal roof; to the gentle, benevolent,
      elevated, unworldly maxims of his father, who &ldquo;passing rich with
      forty pounds a year,&rdquo; infused a spirit into his child which riches
      could not deprave nor poverty degrade. Much of his boyhood, too, had been
      passed in the household of his uncle, the amiable and generous Contarine;
      where he talked of literature with the good pastor, and practiced music
      with his daughter, and delighted them both by his juvenile attempts at
      poetry. These early associations breathed a grace and refinement into his
      mind and tuned it up, after the rough sports on the green, or the frolics
      at the tavern. These led him to turn from the roaring glees of the club,
      to listen to the harp of his cousin Jane; and from the rustic triumph of
      &ldquo;throwing sledge,&rdquo; to a stroll with his flute along the
      pastoral banks of the Inny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle spirit of his father walked with him through life, a pure and
      virtuous monitor; and in all the vicissitudes of his career we find him
      ever more chastened in mind by the sweet and holy recollections of the
      home of his infancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been questioned whether he really had any religious feeling. Those
      who raise the question have never considered well his writings; his Vicar
      of Wakefield, and his pictures of the Village Pastor, present religion
      under its most endearing forms, and with a feeling that could only flow
      from the deep convictions of the heart. When his fair traveling companions
      at Paris urged him to read the Church Service on a Sunday, he replied that
      &ldquo;he was not worthy to do it.&rdquo; He had seen in early life the
      sacred offices performed by his father and his brother, with a solemnity
      which had sanctified them in his memory; how could he presume to undertake
      such functions? His religion has been called in question by Johnson and by
      Boswell; he certainly had not the gloomy hypochondriacal piety of the one,
      nor the babbling mouth-piety of the other; but the spirit of Christian
      charity breathed forth in his writings and illustrated in his conduct give
      us reason to believe he had the indwelling religion of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have made sufficient comments in the preceding chapters on his conduct
      in elevated circles of literature and fashion. The fairy gifts which took
      him there were not accompanied by the gifts and graces necessary to
      sustain him in that artificial sphere. He can neither play the learned
      sage with Johnson, nor the fine gentleman with Beauclerc, though he has a
      mind replete with wisdom and natural shrewdness, and a spirit free from
      vulgarity. The blunders of a fertile but hurried intellect, and the
      awkward display of the student assuming the man of fashion, fix on him a
      character for absurdity and vanity which, like the charge of lunacy, it is
      hard to disprove, however weak the grounds of the charge and strong the
      facts in opposition to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, he is never truly in his place in these learned and fashionable
      circles, which talk and live for display. It is not the kind of society he
      craves. His heart yearns for domestic life; it craves familiar, confiding
      intercourse, family firesides, the guileless and happy company of
      children; these bring out the heartiest and sweetest sympathies of his
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had it been his fate,&rdquo; says the critic we have already
      quoted, &ldquo;to meet a woman who could have loved him, despite his
      faults, and respected him despite his foibles, we cannot but think that
      his life and his genius would have been much more harmonious; his
      desultory affections would have been concentered, his craving self-love
      appeased, his pursuits more settled, his character more solid. A nature
      like Goldsmith&rsquo;s, so affectionate, so confiding&mdash;so susceptible
      to simple, innocent enjoyments&mdash;so dependent on others for the
      sunshine of existence, does not flower if deprived of the atmosphere of
      home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cravings of his heart in this respect are evident, we think,
      throughout his career; and if we have dwelt with more significancy than
      others upon his intercourse with the beautiful Horneck family, it is
      because we fancied we could detect, amid his playful attentions to one of
      its members, a lurking sentiment of tenderness, kept down by conscious
      poverty and a humiliating idea of personal defects. A hopeless feeling of
      this kind&mdash;the last a man would communicate to his friends&mdash;might
      account for much of that fitfulness of conduct, and that gathering
      melancholy, remarked, but not comprehended by his associates, during the
      last year or two of his life; and may have been one of the troubles of the
      mind which aggravated his last illness, and only terminated with his
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall conclude these desultory remarks with a few which have been used
      by us on a former occasion. From the general tone of Goldsmith&rsquo;s
      biography, it is evident that his faults, at the worst, were but negative,
      while his merits were great and decided. He was no one&rsquo;s enemy but
      his own; his errors, in the main, inflicted evil on none but himself, and
      were so blended with humorous, and even affecting circumstances, as to
      disarm anger and conciliate kindness. Where eminent talent is united to
      spotless virtue, we are awed and dazzled into admiration, but our
      admiration is apt to be cold and reverential; while there is something in
      the harmless infirmities of a good and great, but erring individual, that
      pleads touchingly to our nature; and we turn more kindly toward the object
      of our idolatry, when we find that, like ourselves, he is mortal and is
      frail. The epithet so often heard, and in such kindly tones, of &ldquo;Poor
      Goldsmith,&rdquo; speaks volumes. Few who consider the real compound of
      admirable and whimsical qualities which form his character would wish to
      prune away its eccentricities, trim its grotesque luxuriance, and clip it
      down to the decent formalities of rigid virtue. &ldquo;Let not his
      frailties be remembered,&rdquo; said Johnson; &ldquo;he was a very great
      man.&rdquo; But, for our part, we rather say &ldquo;Let them be
      remembered,&rdquo; since their tendency is to endear; and we question
      whether he himself would not feel gratified in hearing his reader, after
      dwelling with admiration on the proofs of his greatness, close the volume
      with the kind-hearted phrase, so fondly and familiarly ejaculated, of
      &ldquo;POOR GOLDSMITH.&rdquo;

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
